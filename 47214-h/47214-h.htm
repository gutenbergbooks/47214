<h2 id="c1">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The &lsquo;Duff Lectures&rsquo; for 1888 were delivered by me
at Edinburgh in the month of March. In introducing
my subject, I spoke to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to express my deep sense of the responsibility
which the writing of these Lectures has laid upon me,
and my earnest desire that they may, by their usefulness,
prove in some degree worthy of the great missionary
whose name they bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dr. Duff was a man of power, who left his own
foot-print so deeply impressed on the soil of Bengal,
that its traces are never likely to be effaced, and still
serve to encourage less ardent spirits, who are striving
to imitate his example in the same field of labour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But not only is the impress of his vigorous personality
still fresh in Bengal. He has earned an enduring
reputation throughout India and the United
Kingdom, as the prince of educational missionaries.
He was in all that he undertook an enthusiastic and
indefatigable workman, of whom, if of any human
being, it might be truly said, that, when called upon
to quit the sphere of his labours, &ldquo;he needed not to be
ashamed.&rdquo; No one can have travelled much in India
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
without having observed how wonderfully the results
of his indomitable energy and fervid eloquence in the
cause of Truth wait on the memory of his work everywhere.
Monuments may be erected and lectureships
founded to perpetuate his name and testify to his
victories over difficulties which few other men could
have overcome, but better than these will be the living
testimony of successive generations of Hind&#363; men and
women, whose growth and progress in true enlightenment
will be due to the seed which he planted, and
to which God has given the increase.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said a few more words expressive of my hope that
the &lsquo;Life of Dr. Duff&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> would be read and pondered
by every student destined for work of any kind in our
Indian empire, and to that biography I refer all who
are unacquainted with the particulars of the labours of
a man to whom Scotland has assigned a place in the
foremost rank of her most eminent Evangelists.</p>
<p>I now proceed to explain the process by which these
Lectures have gradually outgrown the limits required
by the Duff Trustees.</p>
<p>When I addressed myself to the carrying out of their
wishes&mdash;communicated to me by Mr. W. Pirie Duff&mdash;I
had no intention of undertaking more than a concise
account of a subject which I had been studying for
many years. I conceived it possible to compress into
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
six Lectures a scholarly sketch of what may be called
true Buddhism,&mdash;that is, the Buddhism of the Pi&#7789;akas
or P&#257;li texts which are now being edited by the P&#257;li
Text Society, and some of which have been translated
in the &lsquo;Sacred Books of the East.&rsquo; It soon, however,
became apparent to me that to write an account of
Buddhism which would be worthy of the great Indian
missionary, I ought to exhibit it in its connexion with
Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism and even with Jainism,
and in its contrast with Christianity. Then, as I proceeded,
I began to feel that to do justice to my subject
I should be compelled to enlarge the range of my researches,
so as to embrace some of the later phases and
modern developments of Buddhism. This led me to
undertake a more careful study of Koeppen&rsquo;s Lamaismus
than I had before thought necessary. Furthermore,
I felt it my duty to study attentively numerous treatises
on Northern Buddhism, which I had before read
in a cursory manner. I even thought it incumbent on
me to look a little into the Tibetan language, of which
I was before wholly ignorant.</p>
<p>I need scarcely explain further the process of expansion
through which the present work has passed.
A conviction took possession of my mind, that any endeavour
to give even an outline of the whole subject
of Buddhism in six Lectures, would be rather like the
effort of a foolish man trying to paint a panorama of
London on a sheet of note-paper. Hence the expansion
of six Lectures into eighteen, and it will be seen at
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
once that many of these eighteen are far too long to have
been delivered <i>in extenso</i>. In point of fact, by an
arrangement with the Trustees, only a certain portion
of any Lecture was delivered orally. The present work
is rather a treatise on Buddhism printed and published
in memory of Dr. Duff.</p>
<p>I need not encumber the Preface with a re-statement
of the reasons which have made the elucidation of an
intricate subject almost hopelessly difficult. They have
been stated in the Introductory Lecture (pp. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>, <a href="#Page_14">14</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover the plan of the present volume has been
there set forth (see <a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>).</p>
<p>I may possibly be asked by weary readers why I
have ventured to add another tributary to the too
swollen stream of treatises on Buddhism? or some may
employ another metaphor and inquire why I have
troubled myself to toil and plod over a path already
well travelled over and trodden down? My reply is
that I think I can claim for my own work an individuality
which separates it from that of others&mdash;an
individuality which may probably commend it to
thoughtful students of Buddhism as helping to clear
a thorny road, and introduce some little order and
coherence into the chaotic confusion of Buddhistic
ideas.</p>
<p>At any rate I request permission to draw attention
to the following points, which, I think, may invest my
researches with a distinctive character of their own.</p>
<p>In the first place I have been able to avail myself of
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
the latest publications of the P&#257;li Text Society, and to
consult many recent works which previous writers on
Buddhism have not had at their command.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have striven to combine scientific accuracy
with a popular exposition sufficiently readable
to satisfy the wants of the cultured English-speaking
world&mdash;a world crowded with intelligent readers who
take an increasing interest in Buddhism, and yet know
nothing of Sansk&#7771;it, P&#257;li, and Tibetan.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I have aimed at effecting what no other
English Orientalist has, to my knowledge, ever accomplished.
I have endeavoured to deal with a complex
subject as a whole, and to present in one volume a
comprehensive survey of the entire range of Buddhism,
from its earliest origin in India to its latest modern
developments in other Asiatic countries.</p>
<p>Fourthly, I have brought to the study of Buddhism
and its sacred language P&#257;li, a life-long preparatory
study of Br&#257;hmanism and its sacred language Sansk&#7771;it.</p>
<p>Fifthly, I have on three occasions travelled through
the sacred land of Buddhism (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>), and have carried on
my investigations personally in the place of its origin,
as well as in Ceylon and on the borders of Tibet.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have depicted Buddhism from the standpoint
of a believer in Christianity, who has shown, by
his other works on Eastern religions, an earnest desire
to give them credit for all the good they contain.</p>
<p>In regard to this last point, I shall probably be told
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
by some enthusiastic admirers of Buddhism, that my
prepossessions and predilections&mdash;inherited with my
Christianity&mdash;have, in spite of my desire to be just,
distorted my view of a system with which I have no
sympathy. To this I can only reply, that my consciousness
of my own prepossessions has made me the
more sensitively anxious to exhibit Buddhism under
its best aspects, as well as under its worst. An attentive
perusal of my last Lecture (see <a href="#Page_537">p. 537</a>) will, I hope,
make it evident that I have at least done everything
in my power to dismiss all prejudice from my mind,
and to assume and maintain the attitude of an impartial
judge. And to this end I have taken nothing
on trust, or at second hand. I have studied P&#257;li, as
I have the other Indian Pr&#257;k&#7771;its, on my own account,
and independently. I have not accepted unreservedly
any man&rsquo;s interpretation of the original Buddhist texts,
and have endeavoured to verify for myself all doubtful
statements and translations which occur in existing
treatises. Of course I owe much to modern P&#257;li scholars,
and writers on Buddhism, and to the translators of the
&lsquo;Sacred Books of the East;&rsquo; but I have frequently felt
compelled to form an independent opinion of my own.</p>
<p>The translations given in the &lsquo;Sacred Books of the
East&rsquo;&mdash;good as they generally are&mdash;have seemed to
me occasionally misleading. I may mention as an
instance the constant employment by the translators
of the word &lsquo;Ordination&rsquo; for the ceremonies of admission
to the Buddhist monkhood (see pp. <a href="#Page_76">76</a>-80 of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
present volume). I have ventured in such instances
to give what has appeared to me a more suitable
equivalent for the P&#257;li. On the same principle I have
avoided all needless employment of Christian terminology
and Bible-language to express Buddhist ideas.</p>
<p>For example, I have in most cases excluded such
words as &lsquo;sin,&rsquo; &lsquo;holiness,&rsquo; &lsquo;faith&rsquo;, &lsquo;trinity,&rsquo; &lsquo;priest&rsquo; from
my explanations of the Buddhist creed, as wholly unsuitable.</p>
<p>I regret that want of space has compelled me to
curtail my observations on Jainism&mdash;the present representative
of Buddhistic doctrines in India (see <a href="#Page_529">p. 529</a>.)
I hope to enter more fully on this subject hereafter.</p>
<p>The names of authors to whom students of Buddhism
are indebted are given in my first Lecture (pp.
14, 15). We all owe much to Childers. My own
thanks are specially due to General Sir Alexander
Cunningham, to Professor E. B. Cowell of Cambridge,
Professor Rhys Davids, Dr. Oldenberg, Dr. Rost,
Dr. Morris, Dr. Wenzel, who have aided me with their
opinions, whenever I have thought it right to consult
them. Dr. Rost, C.I.E., of the India Office, is also
entitled to my warmest acknowledgments for having
placed at my disposal various subsidiary works bearing
on Buddhism, some of which belong to his own Library.</p>
<p>My obligations to Mr. Hoey&rsquo;s translation of Dr.
Oldenberg&rsquo;s &lsquo;Buddha,&rsquo; to the translations of the travels
of the Chinese pilgrims by Professor Legge, Mr. Beal,
M. Abel R&eacute;musat, and M. Stanislas Julien, to M. Huc&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
travels, and to Mr. Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Burman,&rsquo; will be evident, and
have been generally acknowledged in my notes. I am
particularly grateful to Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s, C.I.E.,
for the information contained in his Report and for the
instruction which I received from him personally while
prosecuting my inquiries at D&#257;rj&#299;ling.</p>
<p>I have felt compelled to abbreviate nearly all my
quotations, and therefore occasionally to alter the
phraseology. Hence I have thought it right to mark
them by a different type without inverted commas.</p>
<p>With regard to transliteration I must refer the student
to the rules for pronunciation given at <a href="#Page_xxxi">p. xxxi</a>. They
conform to the rules given in my Sansk&#7771;it Grammar and
Dictionary. Like Dr. Oldenberg, I have preferred to
substitute Sansk&#7771;it terminations in <i>a</i> for the P&#257;li <i>o</i>. In
Tibetan I have constantly consulted J&auml;schke, but have
not followed his system of transliteration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I may fitly draw attention to the
engravings of objects, some of which were brought by
myself from Buddhist countries. They are described
in the list of illustrations (see <a href="#Page_xxix">p. xxix</a>), and will, I trust,
give value to the present volume. It has seemed to
me a duty to make use of every available appliance for
throwing light on the obscurities of a difficult subject;
and, as these Lectures embrace the whole range of
Buddhism, I have adopted as a frontispiece a portrait
of Buddha which exhibits Buddhism in its receptivity
and in its readiness to adopt serpent-worship, or any
other superstition of the races which it strove to convert.
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
On the other hand, the Wheel, with the Tri-ratna and the
Lotus (pp. <a href="#Page_521">521</a>, <a href="#Page_522">522</a>), is engraved on the title-page as
the best representative symbol of early Buddhism. It is
taken from a Buddhist sculpture at Amar&#257;vat&#299; engraved
for Mr. Fergusson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tree and Serpent-worship&rsquo; (<a href="#Page_237">p. 237</a>).</p>
<p>The portrait which faces <a href="#Page_74">page 74</a> is well worthy of
attention as illustrating the connexion<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> between Buddhism
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
and Br&#257;hmanism. It is from a recently-taken
photograph of Mr. Gaur&#299;-&#7776;a&#7749;kar Uday-&#7776;a&#7749;kar, C.S.I.&mdash;a
well-known and distinguished Br&#257;hman of Bhaunagar&mdash;who
(with Mr. Percival) administered the State
during the minority of the present enlightened Mah&#257;-r&#257;ja.
Like the Buddha of old, he has renounced the
world&mdash;that is, he has become a Sanny&#257;s&#299;, and is chiefly
engaged in meditation. He has consequently dropped
the title C.S.I., and taken the religious title&mdash;Sv&#257;m&#299;
&#7776;r&#299; Sa&#263;&#263;id&#257;nanda-Sarasvat&#299;. His son, Mr. Vijay-&#7776;a&#7749;kar
Gaur&#299;-&#7776;a&#7749;kar, kindly sent me the photograph, and with
his permission I have had it engraved.</p>
<p>It will be easily understood that, as a great portion
of the following pages had to be delivered in the form
of Lectures, occasional repetitions and recapitulations
were unavoidable, but I trust I shall not be amenable
to the charge of repeating anything for the sake of
&lsquo;padding.&rsquo; I shall, with more justice, be accused of
&lsquo;cramming,&rsquo; in the sense of attempting to force too
much information into a single volume.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><i>January 1, 1889.</i></span></p>
<h2 id="c2">POSTSCRIPT.</h2>
<p>Since writing the foregoing prefatory remarks, I have
observed with much concern that a prevalent error, in
regard to Buddhism, is still persistently propagated.
<span class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
It is categorically stated in a newspaper report of
a quite recent lecture, that out of the world&rsquo;s population
of about 1500 millions at least 500 millions are
Buddhists, and that Buddhism numbers more adherents
than any other religion on the surface of the globe.</p>
<p>Almost every European writer on Buddhism, of late
years, has assisted in giving currency to this utterly
erroneous calculation, and it is high time that an attempt
should be made to dissipate a serious misconception.</p>
<p>It is forgotten that mere sympathizers with Buddhism,
who occasionally conform to Buddhistic practices,
are not true Buddhists. In China the great
majority are first of all Confucianists and then either
T&#257;oists or Buddhists or both. In Japan Confucianism
and Shintoism co-exist with Buddhism. In some other
Buddhist countries a kind of Shamanism is practically
dominant. The best authorities (including the Oxford
Professor of Chinese, as stated in the Introduction to
his excellent work &lsquo;The Travels of F&#257;-hien&rsquo;) are of
opinion that there are not more than 100 millions of
real Buddhists in the world, and that Christianity with
its 430 to 450 millions of adherents has now the numerical
preponderance over all other religions. I am
entirely of the same opinion. I hold that the Buddhism,
described in the following pages, contained
within itself, from the earliest times, the germs of
disease, decay, and death (see <a href="#Page_557">p. 557</a>), and that its
present condition is one of rapidly increasing disintegration
and decline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</div>
<p>We must not forget that Buddhism has disappeared
from India proper, although it dominates in Ceylon and
Burma, and although a few Buddhist travellers find their
way back to the land of its origin and sojourn there.</p>
<p>Indeed, if I were called upon to give a rough
comparative numerical estimate of the six chief religious
systems of the world, I should be inclined, on
the whole, to regard Confucianism as constituting, next
to Christianity, the most numerically prevalent creed.
We have to bear in mind the immense populations, both
in China and Japan, whose chief creed is Confucianism.</p>
<p>Professor Legge informs me that Dr. Happer&mdash;an
American Presbyterian Missionary of about 45 years
standing, who has gone carefully into the statistics of
Buddhism&mdash;reckons only 20 millions of Buddhists in
China, and not more than 72&frac12; millions in the whole of
Asia. Dr. Happer states that, if the Chinese were required
to class themselves as Confucianists or Buddhists
or T&#257;oists, 19/20ths, if not 99/100ths, of them would, in his
opinion, claim to be designated as Confucianists.</p>
<p>In all probability his estimate of the number of Buddhists
in China is too low, but the Chinese ambassador
Li&#363;, with whom Professor Legge once had a conversation
on this subject, ridiculed the view that they were
as numerous as the Confucianists.</p>
<p>Undeniably, as it seems to me, the next place after
Christianity and Confucianism should be given to
Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism, which are not really two
systems but practically one; the latter being merely
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
an expansion of the former, modified by contact with
Buddhism.</p>
<p>Br&#257;hmanism, as I have elsewhere shown, is nothing
but spiritual Pantheism; that is, a belief in the universal
diffusion of an impersonal Spirit (called Br&#259;hm&#259;n or
Br&#259;hm&#259;)&mdash;as the only really existing Essence&mdash;and in
its manifesting itself in Mind and in countless material
forces and forms, including gods, demons, men, and
animals, which, after fulfilling their course, must ultimately
be re-absorbed into the one impersonal Essence
and be again evolved in endless evolution and dissolution.</p>
<p>Hind&#363;ism, with its worship of Vish&#7751;u and &#7776;iva, is
based on this pantheistic doctrine, but the majority of
the Hind&#363;s are merely observers of Br&#257;hmanical institutions
with their accompanying Hind&#363; caste usages.
If, however, we employ the term Hind&#363; in its widest
acceptation (omitting only all Isl&#257;mized Hind&#363;s) we
may safely affirm that the adherents of Hind&#363;ism have
reached an aggregate of nearly 200 millions. In the
opinion of Sir William Wilson Hunter, they are still
rapidly increasing, both by excess of births over deaths
and by accretions from more backward systems of belief.</p>
<p>Probably Buddhism has a right to the fourth place
in the scale of numerical comparison. At any rate the
number of Buddhists can scarcely be calculated at less
than 100 millions.</p>
<p>In regard to Muhammadanism, this creed should
not, I think, be placed higher than fifth in the enumeration.
In its purest form it ought to be called
<span class="pb" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
Isl&#257;m, and in that form it is a mere distorted copy of
Judaism.</p>
<p>The Empress of India, as is well known, rules over
more Muhammadans than any other potentate in the
world. Probably the Musalm&#257;n population of the
whole of India now numbers 55 millions.</p>
<p>As to the number of Muhammadans in the Turkish
empire, there are no very trustworthy data to guide us,
but the aggregate is believed to be about 14 millions;
while Africa can scarcely reckon more than that number,
even if Egypt be included.</p>
<p>The sixth system, T&#257;oism (the system of L&#257;o-tsze),
according to Professor Legge, should rank numerically
after both Muhammadanism and Buddhism.</p>
<p>Of course Jainism (<a href="#Page_529">p. 529</a>) and Zoroastrianism (the
religion of the P&#257;rs&#299;s) are too numerically insignificant
to occupy places in the above comparison.</p>
<p>It is possible that a careful census might result in
a more favourable estimate of the number of Buddhists
in the world, than I have here submitted; but at all
events it may safely be alleged that, even as a form
of popular religion, Buddhism is gradually losing its
vitality&mdash;gradually loosening its hold on the vast populations
once loyal to its rule; nay, that the time is
rapidly approaching when its capacity for resistance
must give way before the mighty forces which are
destined in the end to sweep it from the earth.</p>

<p>It is common to hear English-speakers mispronounce

studies the rules on the preceding page will see that
the <i>u</i> in <i>Bud</i>dha, must not be pronounced like the <i>u</i>
in the English word &lsquo;<i>bud</i>,&rsquo; but like the <i>u</i> in b<i>u</i>ll.</p>
<p>Indeed, for the sake of the general reader, it might
be better to write Booddha and Booddhism, provided
the <i>oo</i> be pronounced as in the words &lsquo;wood,&rsquo; &lsquo;good.&rsquo;</p>

<br /><i>Introductory. Buddhism in relation to Br&#257;hmanism.</i></h2>
<p>In my recent work<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> on Br&#257;hmanism I have traced
the progress of Indian religious thought through three
successive stages&mdash;called by me Vedism, Br&#257;hmanism,
and Hind&#363;ism&mdash;the last including the three subdivisions
of &#7776;aivism, Vaish&#7751;avism, and &#7776;&#257;ktism. Furthermore
I have attempted to prove that these systems
are not really separated by sharp lines, but that each
almost imperceptibly shades off into the other.</p>
<p>I have striven also to show that a true Hind&#363; of the
orthodox school is able quite conscientiously to accept
all these developments of religious belief. He holds
that they have their authoritative exponents in the
successive bibles of the Hind&#363; religion, namely, (1) the
four Vedas&mdash;&#7770;ig-veda, Yajur-veda, S&#257;ma-veda, Atharva-veda&mdash;and
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as; (2) the Upanishads; (3) the
Law-books&mdash;especially that of Manu; (4) the Bhakti-&#7777;&#257;stras,
including the R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata,
the Pur&#257;&#7751;as&mdash;especially the Bh&#257;gavata-pur&#257;&#7751;a&mdash;and
the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;; (5) the Tantras.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>The chief works under these five heads represent
the principal periods of religious development through
which the Hind&#363; mind has passed.</p>
<p>Thus, in the first place, the hymns of the Vedas and
the ritualism of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as represent physiolatry
or the worship of the personified forces of nature&mdash;a
form of religion which ultimately became saturated
with sacrificial ideas and with ceremonialism and
asceticism. Secondly, the Upanishads represent the
pantheistic conceptions which terminated in philosophical
Br&#257;hmanism. Thirdly, the Law-books represent
caste-rules and domestic usages. Fourthly, the R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a,
Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata, and Pur&#257;&#7751;as represent the principle
of personal devotion to the personal gods, &#7776;iva, Vish&#7751;u,
and their manifestations; and fifthly, the Tantras represent
the perversion of the principle of love to
polluting and degrading practices disguised under the
name of religious rites. Of these five phases of the
Hind&#363; religion probably the first three only prevailed
when Buddhism arose; but I shall try to make clear
hereafter that Buddhism, as it developed, accommodated
itself to the fourth and even ultimately to the fifth
phase, admitting the Hind&#363; gods into its own creed,
while Hind&#363;ism also received ideas from Buddhism.</p>
<p>At any rate it is clear that the so-called orthodox Br&#257;hman
admits all five series of works as progressive exponents
of the Hind&#363; system&mdash;although he scarcely likes
to confess openly to any adoption of the fifth. Hence
his opinions are of necessity Protean and multiform.</p>
<p>The root ideas of his creed are of course Pantheistic,
in the sense of being grounded on the identification of
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
the whole external world&mdash;which he believes to be a
mere illusory appearance&mdash;with one eternal, impersonal,
spiritual Essence; but his religion is capable of presenting
so many phases, according to the stand-point from
which it is viewed, that its pantheism appears to be
continually sliding into forms of monotheism and polytheism,
and even into the lowest types of animism and
fetishism.</p>
<p>We must not, moreover, forget&mdash;as I have pointed
out in my recent work&mdash;that a large body of the
Hind&#363;s are unorthodox in respect of their interpretation
of the leading doctrine of true Br&#257;hmanism.</p>
<p>Such unorthodox persons may be described as sectarians
or dissenters. That is to say, they dissent from
the orthodox pantheistic doctrine that all gods and men,
all divine and human souls, and all material appearances
are mere illusory manifestations of one impersonal
spiritual Entity&mdash;called &#256;tman or Purusha or
Brahman&mdash;and they believe in one supreme personal
god&mdash;either &#7776;iva or Vish&#7751;u or K&#7771;ish&#7751;a or R&#257;ma&mdash;who
is not liable (as orthodox Br&#257;hmans say he is) to
lose his personality by subjection to the universal law
of dissolution and re-absorption into the one eternal impersonal
Essence, but exists in a heaven of his own,
to the bliss of which his worshippers are admitted<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>And it must be borne in mind that these sectarians
are very far from resting their belief on the Vedas, the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;as, and Upanishads.</p>
<p>Their creed is based entirely on the Bhakti-&#7777;&#257;stras&mdash;that
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
is, on the R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a, Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata, and Pur&#257;&#7751;as
(especially on the Bh&#257;gavata-pur&#257;&#7751;a) and the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,
to the exclusion of the other scriptures of Hind&#363;ism.</p>
<p>Then again it must always be borne in mind that
the terms &lsquo;orthodox&rsquo; and &lsquo;unorthodox&rsquo; have really
little or no application to the great majority of the
inhabitants of India, who in truth are wholly innocent
of any theological opinions at all, and are far too
apathetic to trouble themselves about any form of
religion other than that which has belonged for
centuries to their families and to the localities in
which they live, and far too ignorant and dull of
intellect to be capable of inquiring for themselves
whether that religion is likely to be true or false.</p>
<p>To classify the masses under any one definite denomination,
either as Pantheists or Polytheists or Monotheists,
or as simple idol-worshippers, or fetish-worshippers,
would be wholly misleading.</p>
<p>Their faculties are so enfeebled by the debilitating
effect of early marriages, and so deadened by the drudgery
of daily toil and the dire necessity of keeping body and
soul together, that they can scarcely be said to be
capable of holding any definite theological creed at all.</p>
<p>It would be nearer the truth to say that the religion
of an ordinary Hind&#363; consists in observing caste-customs,
local usages, and family observances, in holding
what may be called the Folk-legends of his neighbourhood,
in propitiating evil spirits and in worshipping
the image and superscription of the Empress of India,
impressed on the current coin of the country.</p>
<p>As a rule such a man gives himself no uneasiness
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
whatever about his prospects of happiness or misery in
the world to come.</p>
<p>He is quite content to commit his interests in a
future life to the care and custody of the Br&#257;hmans;
while, if he thinks about the nature of a Supreme
Being at all, he assumes His benevolence and expects
His good will as a matter of course.</p>
<p>What he really troubles himself about is the necessity
for securing the present favour of the inhabitants
of the unseen world, supposed to occupy the atmosphere
everywhere around him&mdash;of the good and evil
demons and spirits of the soil&mdash;generally represented
by rude and grotesque images, and artfully identified
by village priests and Br&#257;hmans with alleged forms
of Vish&#7751;u or &#7776;iva.</p>
<p>It follows that the mind of the ordinary Hind&#363;,
though indifferent about all definite dogmatic religion,
is steeped in the kind of religiousness best expressed
by the word <span title="deisidaimonia" class="g">&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8055;&alpha;</span>. He lives in perpetual dread
of invisible beings who are thought to be exerting
their mysterious influences above, below, around, in
the immediate vicinity of his own dwelling. The
very winds which sweep across his homestead are
believed to swarm with spirits, who unless duly propitiated
will blight the produce of his fields, or bring
down upon him injury, disease, and death.</p>
<p>Then again, besides the orthodox and besides the
sectarian Hind&#363; and besides the great demon-worshipping,
idolatrous, and superstitious majority, another
class of the Indian community must also be taken into
account&mdash;the class of rationalists and free-thinkers.
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
These have been common in India from the earliest
times.</p>
<p>First came a class of conscientious doubters, who
strove to solve the riddle of life by microscopic self-introspection
and sincere searchings after truth, and
these did their best not to break with the Veda, Vedic
revelation, and the authority of the Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>Earnestly and reverently such men applied themselves
to the difficult task of trying to answer such
questions as&mdash;What am I? Whence have I come?
Whither am I going? How can I explain my consciousness
of personal existence? Have I an immaterial
spirit distinct from, and independent of, my
material frame? Of what nature is the world in which
I find myself? Did an all-powerful Being create it out
of nothing? or did it evolve itself out of an eternal
protoplasmic germ? or did it come together by the
combination of eternal atoms? or is it a mere illusion?
If created by a Being of infinite wisdom and
love, how can I account for the co-existence in it of
good and evil, happiness and misery? Has the Creator
form, or is He formless? Has He qualities and affections,
or has He none?</p>
<p>It was in the effort to solve such insoluble enigmas
by their own unaided intuitions and in a manner not
too subversive of traditional dogma, that the systems
of philosophy founded on the Upanishads originated.</p>
<p>These have been described in my book on Br&#257;hmanism.
They were gradually excogitated by independent
thinkers, who claimed to be Br&#257;hmans or twice-born men,
and nominally accepted the Veda with its Br&#257;hma&#7751;as,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
while they covertly attacked it, or at least abstained from
denouncing it as absolutely untrue. Such men tacitly
submitted to sacerdotal authority, though they really
propounded a way of salvation based entirely on self-evolved
knowledge, and quite independent of all Vedic
sacrifices and sacrificing priests. The most noteworthy
and orthodox of the systems propounded by them was
the Ved&#257;nta<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>, which, as I have shown, was simply
spiritual Pantheism, and asserted that the one Spirit
was the only real Being in the Universe.</p>
<p>But the origin of the more unorthodox systems, which
denied the authority of both the Veda and the Br&#257;hmans,
must also be traced to the influence of the Upanishads.
For it is undeniable that a spirit of atheistic
infidelity grew up in India almost <i>pari passu</i> with
dogmatic Br&#257;hmanism, and has always been prevalent
there. In fact it would be easy to show that periodical
outbursts of unbelief and agnosticism have taken place
in India very much in the same way as in Europe; but
the tendency to run into extremes has always been
greater on Indian soil and beneath the glow and
glamour of Eastern skies. On the one side, a far more
unthinking respect than in any other country has been
paid to the authority of priests, who have declared their
supernatural revelation to be the very breath of God,
sacrificial rites to be the sole instruments of salvation,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
and themselves the sole mediators between earth and
heaven; on the other, far greater latitude than in
any other country has been conceded to infidels and
atheists who have poured contempt on all sacerdotal
dogmas, have denied all supernatural revelation, have
made no secret of their disbelief in a personal God,
and have maintained that even if a Supreme Being
and a spiritual world exist they are unknowable by
man and beyond the cognizance of his faculties.</p>
<p>We learn indeed from certain passages of the Veda
(&#7770;ig-veda II. 12. 5; VIII. 100. 3, 4) that even in the
Vedic age some denied the existence of the god Indra.</p>
<p>We know, too, that Y&#257;ska, the well-known Vedic
commentator, who is believed to have lived before the
grammarian P&#257;&#7751;ini (probably in the fourth century
<span class="small">B.C.</span>), found himself obliged to refute the sceptical
arguments of Kautsa and others who pronounced the
Veda a tissue of nonsense (Nirukta I. 15, 16).</p>
<p>Again, Manu&mdash;whose law-book, according to Dr.
B&uuml;hler, was composed between the second century <span class="small">B.C.</span>
and the second <span class="small">A.D.</span>, and, in my opinion, possibly earlier&mdash;has
the following remark directed against sceptics:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The twice-born man who depending on rationalistic
treatises (hetu-&#7777;&#257;stra) contemns the two roots of law
(&#7777;ruti and sm&#7771;iti), is to be excommunicated (vahish-k&#257;rya&#7717;)
by the righteous as an atheist (n&#257;stika) and
despiser of the Veda&rsquo; (Manu II. 11).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata, a poem which contains
many ancient legends quite as ancient as those of
early Buddhism, relates (&#7776;&#257;nti-parvan 1410, etc.) the
story of the infidel &#262;&#257;rv&#257;ka, who in the disguise of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
mendicant Br&#257;hman uttered sentiments dangerously
heretical.</p>
<p>This &#262;&#257;rv&#257;ka was the supposed founder of a materialistic
school of thought called Lok&#257;yata. Rejecting
all instruments of knowledge (pram&#257;&#7751;a) except perception
by the senses (pratyaksha), he affirmed that the soul
did not exist separately from the body, and that all the
phenomena of the world were spontaneously produced.</p>
<p>The following abbreviation of a passage in the Sarva-dar&#7777;ana-sa&#7749;graha<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
will give some idea of this school&rsquo;s
infidel doctrines, the very name of which (Lok&#257;yata,
&lsquo;generally current in the world&rsquo;) is an evidence of the
popularity they enjoyed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No heaven exists, no final liberation,</p>
<p class="t0">No soul, no other world, no rites of caste,</p>
<p class="t0">No recompense for acts; let life be spent,</p>
<p class="t0">In merriment<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>; let a man borrow money</p>
<p class="t0">And live at ease and feast on melted butter.</p>
<p class="t0">How can this body when reduced to dust</p>
<p class="t0">Revisit earth? and if a ghost can pass</p>
<p class="t0">To other worlds, why does not strong affection</p>
<p class="t0">For those he leaves behind attract him back?</p>
<p class="t0">Oblations, funeral rites, and sacrifices</p>
<p class="t0">Are a mere means of livelihood devised</p>
<p class="t0">By sacerdotal cunning&mdash;nothing more.</p>
<p class="t0">The three composers of the triple Veda</p>
<p class="t0">Were rogues, or evil spirits, or buffoons.</p>
<p class="t0">The recitation of mysterious words</p>
<p class="t0">And jabber of the priests is simple nonsense.</p>
</div>
<p>Then again, the continued prevalence of sceptical
opinions may be shown by extracts from other portions
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of the later literature. For example, in the R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a
(II. 108) the infidel Br&#257;hman J&#257;v&#257;li gives utterance to
similar sentiments thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The books composed by theologians, in which men
are enjoined to worship, give gifts, offer sacrifice,
practise austerities, abandon the world, are mere artifices
to draw forth donations. Make up your mind that
no one exists hereafter. Have regard only to what is
visible and perceptible by the senses (pratyaksham).
Cast everything beyond this behind your back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a parallel passage from the Vish&#7751;u-pur&#257;&#7751;a,
it is declared that the great Deceiver, practising
illusion, beguiled other demon-like beings to embrace
many sorts of heresy; some reviling the Vedas, others
the gods, others the ceremonial of sacrifice, and others
the Br&#257;hmans<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>. These were called N&#257;stikas.</p>
<p>Such extracts prove that the worst forms of scepticism
prevailed in both early and medi&aelig;val times. But all
phases and varieties of heretical thought were not
equally offensive, and it would certainly be unfair and
misleading to place Buddhism and Jainism on the same
level with the reckless Pyrrhonism of the &#262;&#257;rv&#257;kas
who had no code of morality.</p>
<p>And indeed it was for this very reason, that when
Buddhism and Jainism began to make their presence
felt in the fifth century <span class="small">B.C.</span> they became far more formidable
than any other phase of scepticism.</p>
<p>Whether, however, Buddhism or Jainism be entitled
to chronological precedence is still an open question,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
about which opinions may reasonably differ. Some hold
that they were always quite distinct from each other,
and were the products of inquiry originated by two
independent thinkers, and many scholars now consider
that the weight of evidence is in favour of Jainism being
a little antecedent to Buddhism. Possibly the two
systems resulted from the splitting up of one sect into
two divisions, just as the two Br&#257;hma-Sam&#257;jes of Calcutta
are the product of the &#256;di-Sam&#257;j.</p>
<p>One point at least is certain, that notwithstanding
much community of thought between Buddhism and
Jainism, Buddhism ended in gaining for itself by far
the more important position of the two. For although
Jainism has shown more tenacity of life in India, and
has lingered on there till the present day, it never
gained any hold on the masses of the population, whereas
its rival, Buddhism, radiating from a central point in
Hind&#363;st&#257;n, spread itself first over the whole of India
and then over nearly all Eastern Asia, and has played&mdash;as
even its most hostile critics must admit&mdash;an important
r&ocirc;le in the history of the world.</p>
<p>To Buddhism, therefore, we have now to direct our
attention, and at the very threshold of our inquiries we
are confronted with this difficulty, that its great popularity
and its wide diffusion among many peoples have
made it most difficult to answer the question:&mdash;What
is Buddhism? If it were possible to reply to the inquiry
in one word, one might perhaps say that true Buddhism,
theoretically stated, is Humanitarianism, meaning by
that term something very like the gospel of humanity
preached by the Positivist, whose doctrine is the elevation
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
of man through man&mdash;that is, through human
intellect, human intuitions, human teaching, human
experiences, and accumulated human efforts&mdash;to the
highest ideal of perfection; and yet something very
different. For the Buddhist ideal differs toto c&aelig;lo from
the Positivist&rsquo;s, and consists in the renunciation of all
personal existence, even to the extinction of humanity
itself. The Buddhist&rsquo;s perfection is destruction (<a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>).</p>
<p>But such a reply would have only reference to the
truest and earliest form of Buddhism. It would cover
a very minute portion of the vast area of a subject
which, as it grew, became multiform, multilateral, and
almost infinite in its ramifications.</p>
<p>Innumerable writers, indeed, during the past thirty
years have been attracted by the great interest of the
inquiry, and have vied with each other in their efforts
to give a satisfactory account of a system whose developments
have varied in every country; while
lecturers, essayists, and the authors of magazine articles
are constantly adding their contributions to the mass
of floating ideas, and too often propagate crude and
erroneous conceptions on a subject, the depths of which
they have never thoroughly fathomed.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the annexation of Upper
Burma, while giving an impulse to P&#257;li and Buddhistic
studies, may help to throw light on some obscure points.</p>
<p>Certainly Buddhism continues to be little understood
by the great majority of educated persons. Nor can
any misunderstanding on such a subject be matter of
surprise, when writers of high character colour their
descriptions of it from an examination of one part of
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the system only, without due regard to its other phases,
and in this way either exalt it to a far higher position
than it deserves, or depreciate it unfairly.</p>
<p>And Buddhism is a subject which must continue for
a long time to present the student with a boundless
field of investigation. No one can bring a proper capacity
of mind to such a study, much less write about it
clearly, who has not studied the original documents both
in P&#257;li and in Sansk&#7771;it, after a long course of preparation
in the study of Vedism, Br&#257;hmanism, and Hind&#363;ism.
It is a system which resembles these other forms
of Indian religious thought in the great variety of
its aspects. Starting from a very simple proposition,
which can only be described as an exaggerated truism&mdash;the
truism, I mean, that all life involves sorrow,
and that all sorrow results from indulging desires which
ought to be suppressed&mdash;it has branched out into a
vast number of complicated and self-contradictory
propositions and allegations. Its teaching has become
both negative and positive, agnostic and gnostic. It
passes from apparent atheism and materialism to theism,
polytheism, and spiritualism. It is under one aspect
mere pessimism; under another pure philanthropy;
under another monastic communism; under another
high morality; under another a variety of materialistic
philosophy; under another simple demonology; under
another a mere farrago of superstitions, including
necromancy, witchcraft, idolatry, and fetishism. In
some form or other it may be held with almost
any religion, and embraces something from almost
every creed. It is founded on philosophical Br&#257;hmanism,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
has much in common with S&#257;&#7749;khya and
Ved&#257;nta ideas, is closely connected with Vaish&#7751;avism,
and in some of its phases with both &#7776;aivism and
&#7776;&#257;ktism, and yet is, properly speaking, opposed to
every one of these systems. It has in its moral code
much common ground with Christianity, and in its
medi&aelig;val and modern developments presents examples
of forms, ceremonies, litanies, monastic communities,
and hierarchical organizations, scarcely distinguishable
from those of Roman Catholicism; and yet a greater
contrast than that presented by the essential doctrines
of Buddhism and of Christianity can scarcely be
imagined. Strangest of all, Buddhism&mdash;with no God
higher than the perfect man&mdash;has no pretensions to
be called a religion in the true sense of the word, and
is wholly destitute of the vivifying forces necessary to
give vitality to the dry bones of its own morality; and
yet it once existed as a real power over at least
a third of the human race, and even at the present
moment claims a vast number of adherents in Asia,
and not a few sympathisers in Europe and America.</p>
<p>Evidently, then, any Orientalist who undertakes to
give a clear and concise account of Buddhism in the
compass of a few lectures, must find himself engaged
in a very venturesome and difficult task.</p>
<p>Happily we are gaining acquaintance with the
Southern or purest form of Buddhism through editions
and translations of the texts of the P&#257;li Canon by
Fausb&ouml;ll, Childers, Rhys Davids, Oldenberg, Morris,
Trenckner, L. Feer, etc. We owe much, too, to the
works of Turnour, Hardy, Clough, Gogerly, D&rsquo;Alwis,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Burnouf, Lassen, Spiegel, Weber, Koeppen, Minayeff,
Bigandet, Max M&uuml;ller, Kern, Ed. M&uuml;ller, E. Kuhn,
Pischel, and others. These enable us to form a fair
estimate of what Buddhism was in its early days.</p>
<p>But the case is different when we turn to the
Northern Buddhist Scriptures, written generally in
tolerably correct Sansk&#7771;it (with Tibetan translations).
These continue to be little studied, notwithstanding the
materials placed at our command and the good work
done, first by the distinguished &lsquo;founder of the study of
Buddhism,&rsquo; Brian Hodgson, and by Burnouf, Wassiljew,
Cowell, Senart, Kern, Beal, Foucaux, and others. In
fact, the moment we pass from the Buddhism of India,
Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, to that of Nep&#257;l, Kashm&#299;r,
Tibet, Bhut&#257;n, Sikkim, China, Mongolia, Manchuria,
Corea, and Japan, we seem to have entered a labyrinth,
the clue of which is continually slipping from our hands.</p>
<p>Nor is it possible to classify the varying and often
conflicting systems in these latter countries, under the
one general title of Northern Buddhism.</p>
<p>For indeed the changes which religious systems undergo,
even in countries adjacent to each other, not unfrequently
amount to an entire reversal of their whole
character. We may illustrate these changes by the
variations of words derived from one and the same root
in neighbouring countries. Take, for example, the German
words selig, &lsquo;blessed,&rsquo; and knabe, &lsquo;a boy,&rsquo; which
in England are represented by &lsquo;silly&rsquo; and &lsquo;knave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A similar law appears to hold good in the case of
religious ideas. Their whole character seems to change
by a change of latitude and longitude. This is even
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
true of Christianity. Can it be maintained, for instance,
that the Christianity of modern Greece and Rome has
much in common with early Christianity, and would
any casual observer believe that the inhabitants of St.
Petersburg, Berlin, Edinburgh, London, and Paris were
followers of the same religion?</p>
<p>It cannot therefore surprise us if Buddhism developed
into apparently contradictory systems in different
countries and under varying climatic conditions. In no
two countries did it preserve the same features. Even
in India, the land of its birth, it had greatly changed
during the first ten centuries of its prevalence. So
much so that had it been possible for its founder to
reappear upon earth in the fifth century after Christ, he
would have failed to recognize his own child, and would
have found that his own teaching had not escaped the
operation of a law which experience proves to be
universal and inevitable.</p>
<p>It is easy, therefore, to understand how difficult it
will be to give any semblance of unity to my present
subject. It will be impossible for me to treat as a
consistent whole a system having a perpetually varying
front and no settled form. I can only give a series
of somewhat rough, though, I hope, trustworthy outlines,
as far as possible in methodical succession.</p>
<p>And in the carrying out of such a design, the three
objects that will at first naturally present themselves
for delineation will be three which constitute the well-known
triad of early Buddhism&mdash;that is to say, the
Buddha himself, His Law and His Order of Monks.</p>
<p>Hence my aim will be, in the first place, to give such
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
a historical account of the Buddha and of his earliest
teaching as may be gathered from his legendary biography,
and from the most trustworthy parts of the
Buddhist canonical scriptures. Secondly, I shall give a
brief description of the origin and composition of those
scriptures as containing the Buddha&rsquo;s &lsquo;Law&rsquo; (Dharma);
and thirdly, I shall endeavour to explain the early constitution
of the Buddha&rsquo;s Order of Monks (Sa&#7749;gha).
After treating of these three preliminary topics, I shall
next describe the Law itself; that is, the philosophical
doctrines of Buddhism, its code of morality and theory
of perfection, terminating in Nirv&#257;&#7751;a. Lastly, I shall
attempt to trace out the confused outlines of theistic,
mystical, and hierarchical Buddhism, as developed in
Northern countries, adding an account of sacred objects
and places, and contrasting the chief doctrines of Christianity.
In regard to the Buddhism of Tibet, I shall
chiefly base my explanations on Koeppen&rsquo;s great work&mdash;a
work never translated into English and now out of print&mdash;as
well as on my own researches during my travels
through the parts of India bordering on that country.</p>
<p>And here I ought to state that my explanations
and descriptions will, I fear, be wholly deficient in
picturesqueness. My simple aim will be to convey clear
and correct information in unembellished language; and
in doing this, I shall often be compelled to expose myself
to the reproach contained in the expressions, <i>&#263;arvita-&#263;arva&#7751;am</i>,
&lsquo;chewing the chewed,&rsquo; and <i>pish&#7789;a-pesha&#7751;am</i>,
&lsquo;grinding the ground.&rsquo; I shall constantly be obliged
to tread on ground already well trodden.</p>
<p>To begin, then, with the Buddha himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c7">LECTURE II.
<br /><i>The Buddha as a personal Teacher.</i></h2>
<p>It is much to be regretted that among all the sacred
books that constitute the Canon of the Southern Buddhists
(see <a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>)&mdash;the only true Canon of Buddhism&mdash;there
is no trustworthy biography of its Founder.</p>
<p>For Buddhism is nothing without Buddha, just as
Zoroastrianism is nothing without Zoroaster, Confucianism
nothing without Confucius, Muhammadanism
nothing without Muhammad, and I may add with all reverence,
Christianity nothing without Christ.</p>
<p>Indeed, no religion or religious system which has not
emanated from some one heroic central personality, or
in other words, which has not had a founder whose
strongly marked personal character constituted the very
life and soul of his teaching and the chief factor in its
effectiveness, has ever had any chance of achieving
world-wide acceptance, or ever spread far beyond the
place of its origin.</p>
<p>Hence the barest outline of primitive Buddhism must
be incomplete without some sketch of the life and
character of Gautama Buddha himself. Yet it is difficult
to find any sure basis of fact on which we may construct
a fairly credible biography.</p>
<p>In all likelihood legendary histories of the Founder of
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Buddhism were current in Nep&#257;l and Tibet in the early
centuries of our era; but unhappily his too enthusiastic
and imaginative admirers have thought it right to
testify their admiration by interweaving with the probable
facts of Gautama Buddha&rsquo;s life, fables so extravagant
that some modern critical scholars have despaired
of attempting to sift truth from fiction, and have even
gone to the extreme of doubting that Gautama Buddha
ever lived at all.</p>
<p>To believe nothing that has been recorded about him,
is as unreasonable as to accept with unquestioning faith
all the miraculous circumstances which are made to
encircle him as with a halo of divine glory.</p>
<p>We must bear in mind that when Gautama Buddha
lived&mdash;about the fifth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>&mdash;the art of writing
was not common in India<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>. We may point out, too,
that in all countries, European as well as Asiatic&mdash;notably
in Greece (witness, for example, the familiar
instance of Socrates)&mdash;men have thought more of preserving
the sayings of their teachers than of recording
the facts of their lives.</p>
<p>And we must not forget that in India&mdash;where the
imaginative faculties have always been too active, and
anything like real history is unknown&mdash;any plain
matter-of-fact biography of the most heroic personage
would have few charms for any one, and little chance of
gaining acceptance anywhere.</p>
<p>Hence it has happened that the ballads (g&#257;th&#257;)
and legends current about Gautama among Northern
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Buddhists, bristle with the wildest fancies and the most
absurd exaggerations.</p>
<p>Yet it is not impossible to detect a few scattered
historical facts beneath stories, however childish, and
legends, however extravagant. We shall not at least
be far wrong, if, in attempting an outline of the
Buddha&rsquo;s life, we begin by asserting that intense individuality,
fervid earnestness, and severe simplicity of
character, combined with singular beauty of countenance,
calm dignity of bearing, and above all, almost
superhuman persuasiveness of speech, were conspicuous
in the great Teacher.</p>
<p>The earliest authorities, however, never claim for
him anything extraordinary or superhuman in regard
to external form. It was only in later times that Buddhist
writers pandered to the superstitions of the people,
by describing the Buddha as possessed of various
miraculous characteristics of mind and body. He is
said to have been of immense stature&mdash;according to
some, eighteen feet high&mdash;and to have had on his body
thirty-two chief auspicious marks (mah&#257;-vya&ntilde;jana), regarded
as indications of a Supreme Lord and Universal
Ruler, eighty secondary marks (anu-vya&ntilde;jana), besides
one hundred and eight symbols on the sole of each foot,
and a halo extending for six feet round his person.</p>
<p>All that can be said with any degree of probability
about his personal appearance is, that he was endowed
with certain qualities, which acted like a spell, or with
a kind of irresistible magnetism, on his hearers. These
must have formed, so to speak, the foundation-stone on
which the superstructure of his vast influence rested.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">SACRED LAND OF BUDDHISM, AND SCENE OF THE BUDDHA&rsquo;S ITINERATION AND PREACHING FOR FORTY-FIVE YEARS.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Unhappily, no authoritative Buddhist scripture gives
any trustworthy clue to the exact year of the Buddha&rsquo;s
birth. The traditions which refer back his <i>death</i> to a
date corresponding to 543 <span class="small">B.C.</span> are now rejected by
modern European scholars. Nor can we as yet accept
as infallible the results of the latest researches, which
making use of various other data, such as the inscriptions
on coins, rocks, and columns, place his death more
than a century later. We shall not, however, be far
wrong if we assert that he was born about the year
500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> at Kapila-vastu (now Bh&#363;ila)&mdash;a town situated
about half-way between Bast&#299; and Aj&#363;dhy&#257; (Ayodhy&#257;)
in the territory of Kosala (the modern Oudh, see pp. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>,
<a href="#Page_48">48</a>), about sixty miles from its capital city &#7776;r&#257;vasti (a
favourite residence of Gautama), and about one hundred
miles<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> north-west of Benares, and near the borders of
the kingdom of Magadha (now Beh&#257;r).</p>
<p>His father, named &#7776;uddhodana, was a land-owner of
the tribe of the &#7776;&#257;kyas (a name possibly connected with
the Sansk&#7771;it root &#7776;ak, &lsquo;to be powerful&rsquo;), whose territory
in the Gorakh-pur district extended from the lower
Nepalese mountains to the river Rapt&#299; in Oudh. It
has been conjectured that the &#7776;&#257;kyas may have been
originally a non-&#256;ryan tribe, connected perhaps with
certain nomad immigrants from Tibet or Northern Asia,
who may have immigrated into India at various periods;
but even if this could be proved, it would have to be
admitted that the &#7776;&#257;kyas had become &#256;ryanized. It is
said that the chief families claimed to be R&#257;jputs,
tracing back their origin to Ikshv&#257;ku, the first of the
Solar race. It appears, too, that though belonging to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Kshatriya caste, they were agriculturists, and mainly
engaged in the cultivation of rice. It is also asserted
that &#7776;&#257;kya families were in the habit of taking the name
of the family of the Br&#257;hmans who were their spiritual
guides and performed religious offices for them, and that
the family of &#7776;uddhodana took the name Gautama, that
is, descendant of the sage Gotama. It does not, however,
seem necessary to account for the name in this
manner. It was an auspicious name, which in ancient
times might have been given to the child of any great
land-owner as a proof of orthodoxy, or with the view,
perhaps, of pleasing the Br&#257;hmans and securing their
prayers and good wishes on its behalf.</p>
<p>The father of the Founder of Buddhism was simply
a chief of the &#7776;&#257;kya  tribe&mdash;certainly not a king in our
sense of the term&mdash;but rather a great Zam&#299;nd&#257;r or
landlord, whose territory was not so large in area
as Yorkshire. His name &#7776;uddhodana, &lsquo;one possessed
of pure rice,&rsquo; probably indicated the occupation and
ordinary food of the peasantry inhabiting the district
belonging to him and subject to his authority. Those
who have travelled much in India must often have
met great land-owners of the &#7776;uddhodana type&mdash;men
to whom the title Mah&#257;-r&#257;ja is given much as &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;
is to our aristocracy. For example, the Mah&#257;-r&#257;ja of
Darbhanga is probably a more important personage
than Gautama&rsquo;s father ever was, and his territory larger
than that of &#7776;uddhodana ever was.</p>
<p>The name Gautama (in P&#257;li spelt Gotama) was
the personal name corresponding to that given to all
children at the name-giving ceremony. It was not till
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
his supposed attainment of perfect wisdom that Gautama
assumed the title of Buddha, or &lsquo;the enlightened
one.&rsquo; But from that time forward this became his recognized
title. Every other name besides Gautama (or
Gotama), and every other title except Buddha (or together,
Gautama Buddha), are simply epithets; for
example, &#7776;&#257;kya-muni, &lsquo;sage of the tribe of the &#7776;&#257;kyas;&rsquo;
&#7776;&#257;kya-si&#7753;ha, &lsquo;lion of the &#7776;&#257;kyas;&rsquo; &#7776;rama&#7751;a (Samano),
&lsquo;the ascetic;&rsquo; Siddh&#257;rtha, &lsquo;one who has fulfilled the
object (of his coming);&rsquo; Sugata, &lsquo;whose coming is
auspicious;&rsquo; Tath&#257;gata, &lsquo;who comes and goes as his
predecessors;&rsquo; Bhagav&#257;n (Bhagav&#257;), &lsquo;the blessed lord;&rsquo;
&#7776;&#257;st&#257; (Satth&#257;), &lsquo;the Teacher;&rsquo; A&#7777;ara&#7751;a-&#7777;ara&#7751;a, &lsquo;Refuge
of the refugeless;&rsquo; &#256;ditya-bandhu, &lsquo;Kinsman of the
Sun;&rsquo; Jina, &lsquo;conqueror;&rsquo; Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra, &lsquo;great hero;&rsquo; Mah&#257;-purusha,
&lsquo;great man;&rsquo; &#262;akravart&#299;, &lsquo;universal monarch.&rsquo;
Devout Buddhists call him &lsquo;Lord of the World,&rsquo; &lsquo;the
Lord,&rsquo; &lsquo;World-honoured One,&rsquo; &lsquo;King of the Law,&rsquo; &lsquo;the
Jewel,&rsquo; etc.; and prefer to use the titles rather than the
personal name Gautama, which is thought too familiar.</p>
<p>The names of previous Buddhas, supposed to have
existed in previous ages, are given at <a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a>.</p>
<p>Little of the story of the miraculous birth of Buddha
is worthy of repetition. Since, however, a white elephant
is reckoned among the sacred objects of Buddhism,
as something rare and precious, it is worth while
mentioning the fable, that when the time came for the
Bodhi-sattva to leave the Tushita heaven (<a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>) and be
born on earth as Gautama Buddha, he descended into
the womb of his mother in the form of a white elephant.
He was born under a &#7776;&#257;l tree and the god Brahm&#257;
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
received him from his mother&rsquo;s side. His mother, M&#257;y&#257;,
died seven days afterwards, and the infant was committed
to her sister (Mah&#257;-praj&#257;pat&#299;), a second wife of
&#7776;uddhodana.</p>
<p>It is not related of Gautama that, as he grew up,
any efforts were made to imbue him with sacred
learning; though, as a Kshatriya, he was privileged to
receive instruction in certain portions of the Veda.</p>
<p>Nor are we told of him that as a Kshatriya he was
trained to the profession of a soldier. It is more probable,
that his love of contemplation developed itself
very early, and that from a desire to humour this not
uncommon Oriental propensity, he was allowed to pass
most of his time in the open air.</p>
<p>There is a well-known legend, which relates how
Gautama&rsquo;s relations came in a body to his father and
complained that the youth&rsquo;s deficiency in martial and
athletic exercises would incapacitate him, on reaching
manhood, from taking part in warlike expeditions. This
might be reckoned among the few trustworthy historical
incidents, were the story not marred by the legendary
addition, that on a day of trial being fixed, the youth,
without any previous practice, and of course to the
surprise of all present, proved his superiority in archery
and in &lsquo;the twelve arts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One statement may certainly be accepted without
much qualification. It is said that Gautama was made
to marry early, according to the universal custom
throughout India in the present day. No son of any
respectable person in modern times could remain unmarried
at the age of sixteen or seventeen, without, so
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
to speak, tarnishing the family escutcheon, and exposing
the youth himself to a serious social stigma, likely to
cling to him in after-life. In ancient times marriage was
equally universal, and there is no reason to suppose
that among Kshatriyas it was delayed to a much later
period of life.</p>
<p>No doubt, therefore, the future Buddha had at least
one wife (whose name was Ya&#7777;odhar&#257;, though often
called R&#257;hula-m&#257;t&#257;, &lsquo;R&#257;hula&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;), and probably
at least one son, named R&#257;hula. It is said that this
son was not born till his father was twenty-nine years
of age, or not till the time when a sense of the vanity
of all human aims, and a resolution to abandon all
worldly ties, and a longing to enter upon a monastic life
had begun to take possession of his father&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>The story of the four visions, which led to his final
renunciation of the world, is profusely overlaid with
fanciful hyperbole, but, however slight the basis of
fact on which it may reasonably be held to rest, it is too
picturesque and interesting to be passed over without
notice. I therefore here abridge the account given in Mr.
Beal&rsquo;s translation of the Chinese version of the Abhi-nishkrama&#7751;a-s&#363;tra,
varying (for the sake of brevity) the
phraseology, but retaining the expression &lsquo;prince&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>One day the prince Gautama resolved to visit the
gardens in the neighbourhood of his father&rsquo;s city, desiring
to examine the beautiful trees and flowers.</p>
<p>Then there appeared before his eyes in one of the
streets the form of a decrepid[**decrepit] old man, his skin
shrivelled, his head bald, his teeth gone, his body
infirm and bent. A staff supported his tottering limbs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
as he stood right across the path of the prince&rsquo;s advancing
chariot.</p>
<p>Seeing this aged person, Siddh&#257;rtha inquired of his charioteer:&mdash;&lsquo;What
human form is this, so miserable and so
distressing, the like of which I have never seen before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The charioteer replied:&mdash;&lsquo;This is what is called an
old man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince again inquired:&mdash;&lsquo;And what is the exact
meaning of this expression &ldquo;old&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The charioteer answered:&mdash;&lsquo;Old age implies the loss
of bodily power, decay of the vital functions, and failure
of mind and memory. This poor man before you is old
and approaching his end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then asked the prince:&mdash;&lsquo;Is this law universal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;this is the common lot of all living
creatures. All that is born must die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Soon afterwards another strange sight presented
itself&mdash;a sick man, worn by disease and suffering, pale
and miserable, scarcely able to draw his breath, was
seen tottering on the road.</p>
<p>Then the prince inquired of his charioteer:&mdash;&lsquo;Who is
this unhappy being?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The charioteer replied:&mdash;&lsquo;This is a sick man, and
such sickness is common to all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Soon afterwards there passed before them a corpse,
borne on a bier.</p>
<p>Then asked the prince:&mdash;&lsquo;Who is this borne onwards
on his bed, covered with strangely-coloured garments,
surrounded by people weeping and lamenting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This,&rsquo; replied the charioteer, &lsquo;is called a dead body;
he has ended his life; he has no further beauty of
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
form, and no desires of any kind; he is one with the
stones and the felled tree; he is like a ruined wall, or
fallen leaf; no more shall he see his father or mother,
brother or sister, or other relatives; his body is dead,
and your body also must come to this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day on his going out by a different gate there
appeared advancing with measured steps a man with a
shaven crown, and monk&rsquo;s robe&mdash;his right shoulder bare,
a religious staff in his right hand, and a mendicant&rsquo;s
alms-bowl in his left.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is this,&rsquo; the prince inquired, &lsquo;proceeding with
slow and dignified steps, looking neither to the right
hand nor to the left, absorbed in thought, with shaven
head and garments of reddish colour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This man,&rsquo; said the charioteer, &lsquo;devotes himself to
charity, and restrains his appetites and his bodily
desires. He hurts nobody, but does good to all, and
is full of sympathy for all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the prince asked the man himself to give an
account of his own condition.</p>
<p>He answered:&mdash;&lsquo;I am called a homeless ascetic; I
have forsaken the world, relatives, and friends; I seek
deliverance for myself and desire the salvation of all
creatures, and I do harm to none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After hearing these words, the prince went to his
father and said, &lsquo;I wish to become a wandering ascetic
(parivr&#257;jika) and to seek Nirv&#257;na; all worldly things,
O king! are changeable and transitory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such is an epitome of the legendary story of the
&lsquo;four visionary appearances,&rsquo; so called because they are
supposed to have been divine visions or appearances,
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
miraculously produced. The remainder of the legendary
life of Gautama Buddha is interesting and here
and there not without some historical value, and portions
of it I now add in an abridged form.</p>
<p>Very shortly after the occurrences just described,
Gautama receives intelligence of the birth of his son
R&#257;hula. This is the first momentous crisis of his life,
and Gautama remains for a long time lost in profound
thought. He sees in his child the strongest of
all fetters, binding him to family and home. But his
mind is made up. He must fly at once, or be for ever
held in bondage. Around him gather the beautiful
women of his father&rsquo;s household, striving by their
blandishments to divert him from his purpose; but
in vain. He seeks the chamber of his wife, and finds
her asleep with her hand on the head of his infant
son. He longs for a last embrace; but fearing to
arouse her suspicions hurries away. Outside, his
favourite horse is waiting to aid his flight. He accomplishes
the first stage of what Buddhists call with
pride the Mah&#257;bhinishkrama&#7751;a, &lsquo;the great going forth
from home;&rsquo; but not without overcoming other still
more formidable trials. For M&#257;ra, the evil deity who
tempts men to indulge their passions (see <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>), makes
himself visible, and promises the prince all the glories of
empire if he will return to the pleasures of worldly life.</p>
<p>Finding all his allurements disregarded, M&#257;ra alters
his method of attack; he fills the air with mighty
thunderings, and creates on the road before the youthful
fugitive&rsquo;s eyes apparitions of torrents, lofty mountains,
and blazing conflagrations. But nothing alarms or
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
deters him. &lsquo;I would rather,&rsquo; he exclaims, &lsquo;be torn
to pieces limb by limb, or be burnt in a fiery furnace,
or be ground to pieces by a falling mountain than
forego my fixed purpose for one single instant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at a safe distance from his father&rsquo;s territory,
he exchanges garments with a passing beggar, cuts off his
own hair with a sword, and assumes the outward aspect
and character of a wandering ascetic. The hair does
not fall to the ground but is taken up to the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;as
heaven (<a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>), and worshipped by the gods.</p>
<p>His first halting-place is R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha (now R&#257;j-g&#299;r),
the chief city of Magadha, which, with Kosala (Oudh,
pp. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>, <a href="#Page_48">48</a>), afterwards became the holy land of Buddhism.
There he attaches himself as a disciple to two
Br&#257;hmans named &#256;&#7735;&#257;ra (in Sansk&#7771;it &#256;r&#257;&#7693;a, with epithet
K&#257;l&#257;pa or K&#257;l&#257;ma) and Uddaka (Udraka, also written
Rudraka, and called R&#257;ma-putta, Mah&#257;-vagga I. 6. 3),
who imbue him with their own philosophical tenets
and theory of salvation. Sufficient evidence exists to
warrant a belief in this part of the story.</p>
<p>No place in India abounds in more interesting
Buddhistic remains than R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha (about 40 miles
south-east of Patn&#257;), proving that it was one of the most
sacred places of Buddhism, consecrated by some of its
most cherished associations. Its P&#257;li name is R&#257;ja-gaha.
It may be conjectured that the connexion between
the metaphysics of Buddhism and those of Br&#257;hmanism
was due to Gautama&rsquo;s intercourse with the Br&#257;hmans
of this district, and to the ideas he thus imbibed at the
earliest stage of his career.</p>
<p>But to resume our story. Gautama fails to find in
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Br&#257;hmanical philosophy that rest and peace for which
his soul was craving when he left his home.</p>
<p>Still there was another way of emancipation and
union with the Universal Soul, taught by the Br&#257;hmans.
This was the way of Tapas<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>, or self-inflicted bodily pain
and austerity.</p>
<p>From the earliest times a favourite doctrine of
Br&#257;hmanism has been, that self-inflicted bodily suffering
is before all things efficacious for the accumulation
of religious merit, for the acquirement of supernatural
powers, and for the spirit&rsquo;s release from the
bondage of transmigration and its re-absorption into
the One Universal Spirit.</p>
<p>Among other forms of self-inflicted pain, religious
devotees (Tapasv&#299;s) sometimes went through the process
of sitting all day long unmoved during the hottest
months on a prepared platform or plot of ground,
surrounded by five fires, or by four blazing fires, with
the burning sun above their heads as a fifth<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>. Even
gods (and notably &#7776;iva) are described as mortifying
themselves by bodily austerities (<i>tapas</i>), so as not to
be outdone by men; for according to the theory of
Hind&#363;ism, the gods themselves might be supplanted
and even ousted from their rank and position as
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
divinities by the omnipotence acquirable by human
devotees through a protracted endurance of severe bodily
suffering.</p>
<p>Hence we are not surprised to find it recorded of
Gautama Buddha, that seeking in vain for rest in the
teaching of Br&#257;hmanical philosophy, and eager to try
the effect of a course of self-mortification, he wandered
forth from R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha to a wood in the district of Gay&#257;,
called Uruvilv&#257; (or Uruvel&#257;).</p>
<p>There, in company with five other ascetics, he began
his celebrated sexennial fast. Sitting down with his
legs folded under him on a raised seat in a place unsheltered
from sun, wind, rain, dew, and cold, he
gradually reduced his daily allowance of food to a
single grain of rice. Then holding his breath, he
harassed and macerated his body, but all in vain. No
peace of mind came, and no divine enlightenment. He
became convinced of his own folly in resorting to
bodily austerity as a means of attaining supreme enlightenment,
and delivering himself from the evils and
sufferings of life.</p>
<p>Rousing himself, as if from a troubled dream, he
took food and nourishment in a natural way, thereby
incurring the temporary disapproval of his five companions
in self-mortification. Then, when sufficiently
refreshed, he moved away to another spot in the same
district. There, under the shelter of a sacred fig-tree
(A&#7777;vattha, <i>Ficus religiosa</i>, known as the Pippala or
P&#299;pal), in a village, afterwards called Buddha-Gay&#257;,
he gave himself up to higher and higher forms of meditation
(Jh&#257;na = Dhy&#257;na). In this he merely conformed
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
to the Hind&#363; Yoga,&mdash;a method of attaining mystic
union with the Deity, which although not then formulated
into a system, was already in vogue among
the Br&#257;hmans. There can be little doubt that the
Dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;, Dhy&#257;na (see <a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>), and Sam&#257;dhi of the
Yoga were resorted to, even in Gautama&rsquo;s time, as a
means for the attainment of perfect spiritual illumination,
as well as of final absorption in the Deity.</p>
<p>In Manu VI. 72 it is said:&mdash;&lsquo;Let him purge himself
from all taints (dosh&#257;n) by suppression of breath, from
sin by restraints of thought (dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;bhi&#7717;), from sensual
attachments by control, and from unspiritual qualities
by meditation (dhy&#257;nena).&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the later work called Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (see <a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a> of
this volume) it is declared:&mdash;&lsquo;holding his body, head,
and neck quite immovable, seated on a firm seat in a
pure spot with Ku&#7777;a grass around, the devotee (Yog&#299;)
should look only at the tip of his nose, and should
meditate on the Supreme Being&rsquo; (VI. 11, 12). Further
on he is directed to meditate so profoundly as to think
about nothing whatever (VI. 25).</p>
<p>The very G&#257;yatr&#299; or ancient Vedic prayer (&#7770;ig-veda
III. 62. 10, see <a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a> of this volume)&mdash;which is to
Hind&#363;s what the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer is to Christians, and is
still repeated by millions of our Indian fellow-subjects
at their daily devotions&mdash;was originally an act of
meditation, performed with the very object Gautama
had in view&mdash;supreme enlightenment of mind:&mdash;&lsquo;Let
us meditate (Dh&#299;mahi, root <i>dhyai</i>) on the excellent glory
of the divine vivifying Sun, may he enlighten our
understandings.&rsquo; Even the selection of a seat under
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
an A&#7777;vattha tree was in keeping with Br&#257;hmanical
ideas (see &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 335).</p>
<p>The first result, however, of his engaging in abstract
meditation, was that he seemed to himself to be as far
as ever from the emancipation which was the one aim
of his great renunciation. Why not then return to the
world? Why not indulge again in the pleasures of
sense? Why not go back to home, wife, and child?
Thoughts of this kind passed through his mind, while
all his old affections and feelings seemed to revive with
tenfold intensity. Then on one particular night,
during this mental struggle, M&#257;ra, the Destroyer and
personification of carnal desire, seized his opportunity.
The spirit of evil had bided his time; had waited to
assail the sage at the right moment, when protracted
self-mortification had done its work&mdash;when with exhausted
strength he had little power of resistance.</p>
<p>It is certainly remarkable that a great struggle between
good and evil, right and wrong, truth and
error, knowledge and ignorance, light and darkness,
is recognized in all religious systems, however false.
(See a notable allusion to this in &#7776;a&#7749;kara&rsquo;s Commentary
to &#262;h&#257;ndogya Upanishad, p. 26, ll. 2-8.)</p>
<p>The legendary description of the Buddha&rsquo;s temptation,
and of the assault made upon him by M&#257;ra (the deadly
spirit of sensuous desire<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>), and by all his troop of
attendants, is so interesting and curious, notwithstanding
its extravagance, that I here abridge it:&mdash;</p>
<p>Fiends and demons swarmed about him in the form
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
of awful monsters, furies, vampires, hobgoblins, armed
to the teeth with every implement of destruction.
Their million faces were frightful to behold, their limbs
encircled by myriads of serpents, their heads enveloped
in a blaze of fire. They surrounded the saint and
assailed him in a thousand different ways. Missiles
of all kinds were hurled against him; poison and fire
were showered over him&mdash;but the poison changed into
flowers, the fire formed a halo round his head.</p>
<p>The baffled evil one now shifted his ground. He
summoned his sixteen enchanting daughters, and sent
them to display their charms in the presence of the
youthful saint. But the resolute young ascetic was
not to be lured by their wiles. He remained calm
and impassive, and with a stern face rebuked the
maidens for their boldness, forcing them to retire discomfited
and disgraced.</p>
<p>Other forms of temptation followed, and the debilitated
ascetic&rsquo;s strength seemed to be giving way. But
this was merely the crisis. After rising to higher and
higher stages of abstract meditation at the end of a
long night he shook off his foe. The victory was
won, and the light of true knowledge broke upon his
mind. A legend relates that in the first night-watch
he gained a knowledge of all his previous existences;
in the second&mdash;of all present states of being; in the
third&mdash;of the chain of causes and effects (<a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>); and
at the dawn of day he knew all things.</p>
<p>The dawn on which this remarkable struggle terminated
was the birthday of Buddhism. Gautama was
at that time about thirty-five years of age. It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
then, and not till then, that his Bodhi-sattvaship (see
<a href="#Page_135">p. 135</a>) ended and he gained a right to the title Buddha,
&lsquo;the Enlightened.&rsquo; No wonder that the tree under
which he sat became celebrated as &lsquo;the tree of
knowledge and enlightenment.&rsquo; It is remarkable, too,
that just as the night on which the Buddha attained
perfect enlightenment is the most sacred night with
Buddhists, so the Bodhi-tree (in familiar language,
Bo-tree) is their most sacred symbol&mdash;a symbol as dear
to Buddhists as the Cross is to Christians.</p>
<p>And what was this true knowledge, evolved out of
a mind sublimated by intense meditation?</p>
<p>This is, perhaps, the strangest point of all in this
strange story. It was after all a mere partial one-sided
truth&mdash;the outcome of a single line of thought, dwelt
upon with morbid intensity, to the exclusion of every
other line of thought which might have modified and
balanced it. It was an ultra-pessimistic view of the
miseries of life, and a determination to ignore all its
counterbalancing joys. It was the doctrine that this
present life is only one link in a chain of countless
transmigrations&mdash;that existence of all kinds involves
suffering, and that such suffering can only be got rid
of by self-restraint and the extinction of desires, especially
of the desire for continuity of personal existence.</p>
<p>For let it be made clear at the outset, that whatever
may be said of the Christian-like self-renunciation
enjoined by the Buddhist code of morality, the only
self it aims at renouncing is the self of personality, and
the chief self-love it deprecates is the self-love which
consists in craving for continuous individual life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>To those who have never travelled or resided much
in the East, indulgence in such a morbid form of pessimism,
under glowing skies and amid bright surroundings,
may seem almost an impossibility. But those who
know India by personal experience are aware that its
climate is not conducive to optimistic views of life,
and that even in the present day men of the Buddha
type, who seek in various ways to impress their pessimistic
theories of existence on their fellow-men, are
not uncommon.</p>
<p>In the course of my travels I frequently met ascetics
who had given up family and friends, and were leading
a life of morose seclusion, and pretended meditation,
undergoing long courses of bodily mortification. Nay,
I have even seen men who, to prove their utter contempt
for the pleasures of worldly existence, and to render
themselves fit for the extinction of all personality by
absorption into the Universal Soul, have sat in one
posture, or held up one arm for years, or allowed themselves
no bed but a bed of spikes, no shelter but the
foliage of trees<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>. Gautama&rsquo;s course of protracted cogitation
therefore had in it nothing peculiar or original.</p>
<p>Nor need we doubt that certain historical facts underlie
the legendary narrative. We cannot admit with the
learned Senart and Kern that the life of Gautama was
based on a mere solar myth. To us it is more difficult
not to believe than to believe that there lived in the
fifth century <span class="small">B.C.</span> the youthful son of a petty R&#257;ja
or land-owner in Oudh, distinguished from ordinary
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
men by many remarkable qualities of mind and body&mdash;notably
by a thoughtful and contemplative disposition;
that he became impressed with a sense of the vanity of
all earthly aims, and of the suffering caused by disease
and death; that he often said to himself, &lsquo;Life is but a
troubled dream, an incubus, a nightmare,&rsquo; or, like the
Jewish sage of old, &lsquo;All the days of man are sorrow,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Man walketh in a vain shadow and disquieteth himself
in vain;&rsquo; and that like many other of the world&rsquo;s philosophers,
instead of acquiescing in the state of things
around him, and striving to make the best of them, or
to improve them, he took refuge from the troubles of
life in abandoning all its ties, renouncing all its joys,
and suppressing all its affections and desires.</p>
<p>And again, it is more difficult not to believe than to
believe that in such a man introspection and abstinence,
protracted for many years, induced a condition of
mind favourable to ecstatic visions, which were easily
mistaken for flashes of inner enlightenment.</p>
<p>We know, indeed, that eleven centuries later another
great thinker arose among the Semitic races in Western
Asia, who went through the same kind of mental
struggle, and that Muhammad, like Gautama, having
by his long fasts and austerities brought himself into a
highly wrought condition of the nervous system, became
a fanatical believer in the reality of his own delusions
and in his own divine commission as a teacher.</p>
<p>But the parallel between the Buddha and Muhammad
cannot be carried on much further. And indeed, in
point of fact, no two characters could be more different.
For the Buddha never claimed to be the channel of
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
a supernatural revelation; never represented the knowledge
that burst on his mind as springing from any but
an internal source; never taught that a divine force
operating from without compelled him to communicate
that knowledge to mankind; never dreamed of propagating
that knowledge to others by compulsion, much
less by the sword. On the contrary, he always maintained
that the only revelation he had received was an
illumination from within&mdash;due entirety to his own
intuitions, assisted by his reasoning powers and by severe
purgatorial discipline protracted through countless previous
births in every variety of bodily form.</p>
<p>But how did this internal self-enlightenment<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>&mdash;the
great distinguishing feature of Buddhism&mdash;first find
expression? It is said that the first words uttered by
the Buddha at the momentous crisis when true knowledge
burst upon him, were to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Through countless births have I wandered, seeking
but not discovering (anibbisan) the maker of this my
mortal dwelling-house (gaha-k&#257;raka), and still again
and again have birth and life and pain returned. But
now at length art thou discovered, thou builder of
this house (of flesh). No longer shalt thou rear a
house for me. Rafters and beams are shattered and
with destruction of Desire (Ta&#7753;h&#257;) deliverance from
repeated life is gained at last&rsquo; (Dhamma-pada 153,
154, Suma&#7749;gala 46).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Contrast with these first utterances of Gautama
Buddha the first words of Jesus Christ:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wist ye not that I must be about My Father&rsquo;s
business?&rsquo; (St. Luke ii. 49.)</p>
<p>The Buddha&rsquo;s first exclamations, as well as the account
of his subsequent sayings and doings, are the more
worthy of credit as taken from the Southern Canon.</p>
<p>The Mah&#257;-vagga (I. 1) tells us that after attaining
complete intelligence, the Buddha sat cross-legged on
the ground under the Bodhi-tree for seven days, absorbed
in meditation and enjoying the bliss of enlightenment.
At the end of that period, during the first three
watches of the night, he fixed his mind on the causes
of existence. Then having thought out the law of
causation (<a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>), he exclaimed: &lsquo;When the laws of
being become manifest to the earnest thinker, his doubts
vanish, and, like the Sun, he dispels the hosts of M&#257;ra.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next he meditated for another seven days under
a banyan tree, called the tree of goat-herds (aja-p&#257;la).
It was there that a haughty Br&#257;hman accosted him
with the question, &lsquo;Who is a true Br&#257;hman?&rsquo; and was
told, &lsquo;One free from evil and pride; self-restrained,
learned, and pure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he meditated under another tree for a third
period of seven days. There the serpent (N&#257;ga)
Mu&#263;alinda (or Mu&#263;ilinda) coiled his body round the
Buddha, and formed a canopy to protect him from the
raging of a storm&mdash;this being one of the trials he had
to go through. When it was over the Buddha exclaimed,
&lsquo;Happy is the seclusion of the satisfied man
(tush&#7789;a) who has learned and seen the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>A fourth period of meditation was passed under the
tree R&#257;j&#257;yatana, making four times seven days. May not
these symbolize the four stages of meditation (<a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>)?
Later legends, however, reckon seven times seven days.</p>
<p>During the whole of the interval between the first
acquisition of knowledge and the setting forth to
proclaim it, the Buddha fasted, being too elated to seek
food, and only once receiving it from two merchants,
named Tapussa (Trapusha) and Bhallika. These became
his first lay-reverers (<a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>) by repeating the
<i>double</i> formula of reverence for the Buddha and for his
doctrine (the Sa&#7749;gha not being then instituted, Mah&#257;-v&deg;
I. 4. 5). A later legend relates that they received in
return eight of his hairs which they preserved as relics.</p>
<p>In connexion with the legend of a forty-nine days&rsquo;
fast, I may mention that an ancient carving of Gautama
was pointed out to me at Buddha-Gay&#257;, which represents
him as holding a bowl of rice-milk divided into forty-nine
portions, one for each day.</p>
<p>With these legends we may contrast the simple Gospel
narrative of Christ&rsquo;s forty days&rsquo; fast in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The Buddha&rsquo;s first resolution to come forth from
his seclusion and proclaim his gospel to mankind is of
course a great epoch with all Buddhists.</p>
<p>And here it should be observed, that, strictly, according
to Gautama&rsquo;s own teaching he ought to have ceased
from all action on arriving at perfect enlightenment.
For had he not attained the great object of his ambition&mdash;the
end of all his struggles&mdash;the goal of all his efforts&mdash;carried
on through hundreds of existences? He had,
therefore, no more lives to lead, no more misery to
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
undergo. In short he had achieved the summum
bonum of all true Buddhists&mdash;the extinction of the
fires of passions and desires&mdash;and had only to enjoy the
well-earned peace (nirv&#7771;iti) of complete Nirv&#257;&#7751;a. Yet
the love of his fellow-men impelled him to action
(prav&#7771;itti). In fact it was characteristic of a supreme
Buddha that he should belie, by his own activity and
compassionate feelings, the utter apathy and indifference
to which his own doctrines logically led (<a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>).</p>
<p>But he did not carry out his benevolent design without
going through another course of temptation (which
it is usual to compare with the temptation of Christ).
Evil thoughts arose in his mind, and these were
suggested, according to later legends, by M&#257;ra (<a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>),
thus:&mdash;&lsquo;With great pains, blessed one, hast thou acquired
this doctrine (dharma). Why proclaim it?
Beings lost in desires and lusts will not understand it.
Remain in quietude. Enjoy Nirv&#257;&#7751;a&rsquo; (Mah&#257;-v&deg; I. 5. 3).</p>
<p>To counteract these malevolent suggestions, the god
Brahm&#257; Sah&#257;mpati (P&#257;li Sah&#259;mpati, <a href="#Page_210">p. 210</a>) presented
himself and exclaimed:&mdash;&lsquo;Arise, O spotless one, open
the gate of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a. Arise, look down on the world lost
in suffering. Arise, wander forth, preach the doctrine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>First the Buddha thought of his two teachers, &#256;&#7735;&#257;ra
and Uddaka (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>), but found they were dead.
Next he thought of the five ascetics whom he had
offended by his abandonment of the method of gaining
true knowledge through painful austerities. They
were at that time prosecuting their bodily mortifications
at Benares in the Deer-park called Isipatana. It was
only natural that the Buddha should think of wending
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
his way in the first instance to Benares, even if special
considerations had not drawn him there; for that city
was the great centre of Eastern thought and life, the
Indian Athens, where all peculiar doctrines were most
likely to gain a hearing.</p>
<p>On his way thither, Upaka, a member of the &#256;j&#299;vaka
sect of naked ascetics, met him and inquired why his
countenance was so bright (pari&#7777;uddha)? He replied, &lsquo;I
am the all-subduer, the all-wise, the stainless, the highest
teacher, the conqueror (<a href="#Page_135">p. 135</a>); I go to Benares to dissipate
the world&rsquo;s darkness&rsquo; (Mah&#257;-vagga I. 6. 7).</p>
<p>The five ascetics (Kau&#7751;&#7693;inya = Ko&#7751;&#7693;a&ntilde;&ntilde;o, A&#7777;vajit =
Assaji, V&#257;shpa, Mah&#257;n&#257;ma, and Bhadrika) were soon converted
by his words, and by merely repeating the triple
formula were admitted at once to his Order of monks.
They constituted, with Gautama, the first six members
of the Sa&#7749;gha, or fraternity of men seeking release from
the misery of existence by c&oelig;nobitic monasticism.</p>
<p>And of what nature were Gautama Buddha&rsquo;s first
didactic utterances? His first sermon, delivered in the
Deer-park at Benares, is held in as much reverence by
Buddhists as the first words of Christ are by Christians.
It is called Dhamma-&#263;akka-ppavattana-sutta, or in
Sansk&#7771;it Dharma-&#263;akra-pravartana-s&#363;tra, &lsquo;the discourse
which set in motion the wheel of the law,&rsquo; or &lsquo;of the
universal dominance of the true belief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following is the substance of it, as given in the
Mah&#257;-vagga (I. 6. 17). It is important to note that the
Buddha spoke in the vernacular of Magadha (now
called P&#257;li), and not to men generally, but to the first
five would-be members of his Order of monks:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&lsquo;There are two extremes (ant&#257;), O monks (Bhikkhus),
to be avoided by one who has given up the world&mdash;a
life devoted to sensual pleasures (k&#257;ma), which is degrading,
common, vulgar, ignoble, profitless; and a life given
to self-mortification (&#257;tma-klamatha)&mdash;painful, ignoble,
profitless. There is a middle path, avoiding both extremes&mdash;the
noble eightfold path discovered by the
Buddha (Tath&#257;gata)&mdash;which leads to insight, to wisdom,
to quietude (upa&#7777;ama), to knowledge, to perfect enlightenment
(sambodhi), to final extinction of desire
and suffering (Nirv&#257;&#7751;a).&rsquo;</p>
<p>So far there is nothing very explicit in the discourse.
Doubtless such precepts as &lsquo;virtue is a mean&rsquo; and that
&lsquo;medio tutissimus ibis&rsquo; are useful, though trite, truths;
but the difficulty is to prove that the Buddha&rsquo;s eightfold
path is really a middle course of the kind described;
for the most fanatical enthusiasts will always regard
their own creed, however extravagant, as moderate.</p>
<p>The Buddha, therefore, goes on to propound what he
calls the four noble truths (ariya-sa&#263;&#263;&#257;ni = &#257;rya-saty&#257;ni),
which are the key to his whole doctrine. They may be
stated thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. All existence&mdash;that is, existence in any form,
whether on earth or in heavenly spheres&mdash;necessarily
involves pain and suffering (dukkha). 2. All suffering
is caused by lust (r&#257;ga) or craving or desire (ta&#7753;h&#257; =
trish&#7751;&#257;, &lsquo;thirst&rsquo;) of three kinds&mdash;for sensual pleasure
(k&#257;ma), for wealth (vibhava), and for existence (bhava).
3. Cessation of suffering is simultaneous with extinction
of lust, craving, and desire (<a href="#Page_139">p. 139</a>). 4. Extinction of
lust, craving, and desire, and cessation of suffering are
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
accomplished by perseverance in the noble eightfold
path (ariyo a&#7789;&#7789;hangiko maggo), viz. right belief or views
(samm&#257; di&#7789;&#7789;hi), right resolve (sa&#7749;kappo), right speech,
right work (kammanto), right livelihood (&#257;j&#299;vo), right
exercise or training (v&#257;y&#257;mo = vy&#257;y&#257;ma), right mindfulness
(sati, <a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>), right mental concentration (sam&#257;dhi).</p>
<p>And how is all life mere suffering (I.6.19)?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Birth is suffering. Decay is suffering. Illness is suffering. Death
is suffering. Association with (samprayogo) objects we hate is suffering.
Separation from objects we love is suffering. Not to obtain
what we desire is suffering. Clinging (up&#257;d&#257;na) to the five elements
(<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>) of existence is suffering. Complete cessation of thirst (ta&#7751;h&#257;)
and desires is cessation of suffering. This is the noble truth of suffering.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sermon (called in Ceylon the first Ba&#7751;a = Bh&#257;&#7751;a,
&lsquo;recitation,&rsquo; <a href="#Page_70">p. 70</a>) was addressed to monks, and however
unfavourably it must compare with that of Christ (St.
Luke iv. 18), addressed not to monks but to suffering
sinners&mdash;and however obvious may be the idea that pain
must result from giving way to lust and the desire for
life through countless existences&mdash;is of great interest
because it embodies the first teaching of one, who, if not
worthy to be called &lsquo;the Light of Asia,&rsquo; and certainly
unworthy of comparison with the &lsquo;Light of the World,&rsquo;
was at least one of the world&rsquo;s most successful teachers.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that, as the result of his earliest meditation
(pp. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>, <a href="#Page_56">56</a>, <a href="#Page_102">102</a>), the Buddha made ignorance
precede lust as the primary cause of life&rsquo;s misery.</p>
<p>Of course the real significance of the whole sermon
depends on the interpretation of the word &lsquo;right&rsquo;
(samm&#257; = samyak) in describing the eightfold path,
and the plain explanation is that &lsquo;right belief&rsquo; means
believing in the Buddha and his doctrine; &lsquo;right resolve&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
means abandoning one&rsquo;s wife and family as the
best method of extinguishing the fires of the passions;
right speech is recitation of the Buddha&rsquo;s doctrine; right
work (Karm&#257;nta) is that of a monk; right livelihood is
living by alms as a monk does; right exercise is suppression
of the individual self; right mindfulness (Sm&#7771;iti)
is keeping in mind the impurities and impermanence of
the body; right mental concentration is trance-like
quietude.</p>
<p>Mark, too, that in describing the misery of life, association
with loved objects is not mentioned as compensating
for the pain of connexion with hateful objects.</p>
<p>The Buddha&rsquo;s early disciples were not poor men; for
the sixth to be admitted to the Sa&#7749;gha was a high-born
youth named Yasa. Then this youth&rsquo;s father, a rich
merchant, became the first lay-disciple by repeating the
<i>triple</i> formula (pp. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>, <a href="#Page_78">78</a>), and his mother and wife
became the first lay-sisters. Next, four high-born friends
of Yasa, and subsequently fifty more became monks.
Thus, not long after the first sermon, Gautama had
sixty enrolled monks; all from the upper classes.</p>
<p>In sending forth these sixty monks to proclaim his
own gospel of deliverance, he addressed them thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am delivered from all fetters (<a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>), human and
divine. You too, O monks, are freed from the same
fetters. Go forth and wander everywhere, out of compassion
for the world and for the welfare of gods and
men. Go forth, one by one, in different directions.
Preach the doctrine (Dharmam), salutary (kaly&#257;&#7751;a) in its
beginning, middle, and end, in its spirit (artha) and in
its letter (vya&ntilde;jana). Proclaim a life of perfect restraint,
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
chastity, and celibacy (brahma&#263;ariyam). I will go also
to preach this doctrine&rsquo; (Mah&#257;-vagga I. 11. 1).</p>
<p>When his monk-missionaries had departed, Gautama
himself followed, though not till M&#257;ra (<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>) had again
tempted him. Quitting Benares he journeyed back to
Uruvel&#257;, near Gay&#257;. There he first converted thirty
rich young men and then one thousand orthodox Br&#257;hmans,
led by K&#257;&#7777;yapa and his two brothers, who maintained
a sacred fire (&lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism,&rsquo; p. 364). The fire-chamber
was haunted by a fiery snake-demon; so Buddha
asked to occupy the room for a night, fought the serpent
and confined him in his own alms-bowl. Next he worked
other miracles (said to have been 3500 in number),
such as causing water to recede, fire-wood to split, fire-vessels
to appear at his word. Then K&#257;&#7777;yapa and his
brothers, convinced of his miraculous powers, were
admitted with the other Br&#257;hmans to the Sa&#7749;gha. Thus
Buddha gathered round him about a thousand monks.</p>
<p>To them on a hill Gay&#257;s&#299;sa (Brahma-yoni), near
Gay&#257;, he preached his &lsquo;burning&rsquo; fire-sermon (Mah&#257;-v&deg;
I. 21): &lsquo;Everything, O monks, is burning (&#257;dittam =
&#257;d&#299;ptam). The eye is burning; visible things are
burning. The sensation produced by contact with
visible things is burning&mdash;burning with the fire of lust
(desire), enmity and delusion (r&#257;gaggin&#257; dosaggin&#257;
mohaggin&#257;), with birth, decay (jaray&#257;), death, grief,
lamentation, pain, dejection (domanassehi), and despair
(up&#257;y&#257;sehi). The ear is burning, sounds are burning;
the nose is burning, odours are burning; the tongue is
burning, tastes are burning; the body is burning,
objects of sense are burning. The mind is burning,
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
thoughts are burning. All are burning with the fire of
passions and lusts. Observing this, O monks, a wise
and noble disciple becomes weary of (or disgusted with)
the eye, weary of visible things, weary of the ear,
weary of sounds, weary of odours, weary of tastes,
weary of the body, weary of the mind. Becoming
weary, he frees himself from passions and lusts. When
free, he realizes that his object is accomplished, that
he has lived a life of restraint and chastity (brahma-&#263;ariyam),
that re-birth is ended.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is said that this fire-sermon&mdash;which is a key to
the meaning of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a&mdash;was suggested by the sight
of a conflagration. It was Gautama&rsquo;s custom to impress
ideas on his hearers by pointing to visible objects. He
compares all life to a flame; and the gist of the discourse
is the duty of extinguishing the fire of lusts, and with it
the fire of all existence, and the importance of monkhood
and celibacy for the attainment of this end.</p>
<p>Contrast in Christ&rsquo;s Sermon on the Mount the words
addressed to the multitude (not to monks), &lsquo;Blessed are
the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Buddha and his followers next proceeded to R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha.
Among them were two, afterwards called &lsquo;chief
disciples&rsquo; (Agra-&#7777;r&#257;vakas), S&#257;riputta and Moggall&#257;na (or
Maudgaly&#257;yana), who died before the Buddha, and sixteen
leaders among the so-called eighty &lsquo;<i>great</i> disciples&rsquo;
(Mah&#257;-&#7777;r&#257;vakas); the chief of these being K&#257;&#7777;yapa (or
Mah&#257;-k&#257;&#7777;yapa), Up&#257;li, and &#256;nanda (a cousin), besides
Anuruddha (another cousin), and K&#257;ty&#257;yana. Of course
among the eighty are reckoned the five original Benares
converts. At a later time two chief female disciples
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
(Agra-&#7777;r&#257;vik&#257;s) named Khem&#257; and Uppala-va&#7751;&#7751;&#257; (Utpala-var&#7751;&#257;)
were added (see <a href="#Page_86">p. 86</a>). Each leading
disciple was afterwards called Sthavira, &lsquo;an elder,&rsquo; or
Mah&#257;-sthavira, &lsquo;great elder&rsquo; (P&#257;li Thera, Mah&#257;thera;
fem. Ther&#299;). Mark, too, that Bimbi-s&#257;ra, king of
Magadha, and Prasenajit (Pasenadi), king of Kosala,
were Gautama&rsquo;s lay-disciples and constant patrons.</p>
<p>It was not long before the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were
more formally incorporated into a monastic Order
(Sa&#7749;gha), and rules of discipline drawn up (see pp. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>,
<a href="#Page_72">72</a>, <a href="#Page_73">73</a>, <a href="#Page_83">83</a>). And doubtless the success of Buddhism was
due to the carrying out of this idea of establishing a
brotherhood offering a haven of rest to all.</p>
<p>About forty-five years elapsed between Gautama&rsquo;s
attainment of Buddhahood and his death. During
that period he continued teaching and itinerating with
his disciples; only going &lsquo;into retreat&rsquo; during the rains.
A list of 45 places of residence is given. He seems to
have resided oftenest at &#7776;r&#257;vast&#299; (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>) in the monastery
Jetavana given by An&#257;tha-pi&#7751;&#7693;ika; but the whole
region between &#7776;r&#257;vast&#299; and R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>), for nearly
300 miles, was the scene of his itineration. Favourite
resorts near R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha were the &lsquo;Vulture-peak&rsquo; and
Bambu-grove (Ve&#7735;u-vana); but continual itineration was
one chief means of propagating Buddhism.</p>
<p>It is said that his death occurred at Ku&#7777;i-nagara<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>
(Kusin&#257;r&#257;), a town about eighty miles east of Kapila-vastu&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
place of his birth&mdash;when he was eighty
years of age, and probably about the year 420 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The story is that Gautama died from eating too much
pork (or dried boar&rsquo;s flesh<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>). As this is somewhat derogatory
to his dignity it is not likely to have been fabricated.
A fabrication, too, would scarcely make him guilty
of the inconsistency of saying &lsquo;Kill no living thing,&rsquo; and
yet setting an example of eating flesh-meat.</p>
<p>These were his words when he felt his end near:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O &#256;nanda, I am now grown old, and full of years,
and my journey is drawing to its close; I have reached
eighty years&mdash;my sum of days&mdash;and just as a worn-out
cart can only with much care be made to move along,
so my body can only be kept going with difficulty. It
is only when I become plunged in meditation that my
body is at ease. In future be ye to yourselves your own
light, your own refuge; seek no other refuge. Hold
fast to the truth as your lamp. Hold fast to the truth
as your refuge; look not to any one but yourselves as a
refuge&rsquo; (Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na-sutta II. 32, 33).</p>
<p>Afterwards he gave a summary of every monk&rsquo;s
duties, thus:&mdash;&lsquo;Which then, O monks, are the truths
(=the seven jewels, <a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>) it behoves you to spread
abroad, out of pity for the world, for the good of gods
and men? They are: 1. the four earnest reflections
(Sm&#7771;iti, Sati-pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na, on the impurities of the body, on
the impermanence of the sensations, of the thoughts, of
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
the conditions of existence, <a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>); 2. the four right
exertions (Sammappadh&#257;na, viz. to prevent demerit
from arising, get rid of it when arisen, produce merit,
increase it); 3. the four paths to supernatural power
(Iddhi-p&#257;da, viz. will, effort, thought, intense thought);
4. the five forces (Pa&ntilde;&#263;a-bala, viz. faith, energy, recollection,
self-concentration, reason); 5. the proper use of the
five organs of sense; 6. the seven &lsquo;limbs&rsquo; of knowledge
(Bodhy-a&#7749;ga, viz. recollection, investigation, energy, joy,
serenity, concentration of mind, equanimity); 7. the noble
&lsquo;eightfold path&rsquo; (<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>). See Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na III. 65.</p>
<p>Then shortly before his decease, he said, &lsquo;It may be,
&#256;nanda, that in some of you the thought may arise:&mdash;The
words of our Teacher are ended; we have lost our
Master. But it is not thus. The truths and the rules
of the Order, which I have taught and preached, let
these be your teacher, when I am gone&rsquo; (VI. 1).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Behold now, O monks, I exhort you:&mdash;Everything
that cometh into being passeth away; work out your
own perfection with diligence&rsquo; (III. 66).</p>
<p>Not long after his last utterances the Buddha, who had
before through intense meditation attained Nirv&#257;&#7751;a or
extinction of the fire of desires, passed through the four
stages of meditation (<a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>) till the moment came for
his Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a, whereby the fire of life also was extinguished.
A couch had been placed for him between
two &#7776;&#257;l trees (<a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>), with the head towards the north.
In sculptures he is represented as lying on his right
side at the moment of death, and images of him in this
position are highly venerated.</p>
<p>The chief men of Ku&#7777;i-nagara burnt his body with
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
the ceremonies usual at the death of a &#262;akravartin or
Universal Ruler, which the Buddha claimed to be.</p>
<p>Then his ashes were distributed among eight princes,
who built St&#363;pas over them (Buddha-va&#7753;sa 28).</p>
<p>A legend states that when the Buddha died there
was an earthquake. Then the gods Brahm&#257; and Indra
appeared and the latter exclaimed: &lsquo;Transient are all
the elements of being; birth and decay are their nature;
they are born and dissolved; then only is happiness
when they have ceased to be&rsquo; (Mah&#257;-p&deg; VI. 16).</p>
<p>Contrast with Buddha&rsquo;s last words the last words of
Christ: &lsquo;Father, into Thy hands I commend my Spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A greater contrast than that presented by the account
of the Buddha&rsquo;s death and the Gospel narrative of the
death of Christ can scarcely be imagined.</p>
<p>Of course as a result of discourses during forty-five
years, a large number were gathered into Gautama&rsquo;s
monastic Order. His first aim was the founding of
this Order, and his chief sermons were to his monks;
but he accepted all men and ultimately multitudes
attached themselves to him as lay-brethren (<a href="#Page_87">p. 87</a>).</p>
<p>In fact Gautama&rsquo;s doctrine of a universal brotherhood,
open to all, constituted the corner-stone of his
popularity. He spoke to them in their own provincial
dialect, which could not have differed much from the
P&#257;li of the texts&mdash;and he enforced his words by
dialogues, parables, fables, reiterations, and repetitions.
Probably he was the first introducer of real preaching into
India, and by his practical method he seemed to bring
down knowledge from the clouds to every man&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>The following parable is an example: &lsquo;As the
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
peasant sows the seed but cannot say: the grain shall
swell to-day, to-morrow germinate, so also it is with
the disciple; he must obey the precepts, practise
meditation, study the doctrine; he cannot say to-day
or to-morrow, I shall be delivered. Again: as when a
herd of deer lives in a forest a man comes who opens
for them a false path and the deer suffer hurt; and
another comes who opens a safe path and the deer
thrive; so when men live among pleasures the evil
one comes and opens the false eightfold path. Then
comes the perfect one and opens the safe eightfold path
of right belief, etc.&rsquo; (<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>, Oldenberg, 191, 192).</p>
<p>Six rival heretical teachers are alluded to. His chief
opponent was his cousin Devadatta, who set up a school
of his own, and is said to have plotted against the
Buddha&rsquo;s life. His efforts failed (&#262;ulla-vagga VII), and
he himself came to an untimely end. Possibly he may
have belonged to the rival Jaina sect (Niga&#7751;&#7789;ha) of
naked ascetics, of which the great leader was Vardham&#257;na
Mah&#257;v&#299;ra N&#257;ta-putta (=J&ntilde;&#257;ti-putra).</p>
<p>Gautama&rsquo;s teaching gained the day. It claimed universality,
and was aptly symbolized by a wheel rolling
among all alike. Yet at first it had no attractions for
the poor and the child-like.</p>
<p>By degrees, a fuller system, adapted in an ascending
scale to laymen, novices, monks, nuns, and Arhats, was
developed&mdash;a system which had its abstruse doctrines
suited to men of philosophical minds, as well as its plain
practical side. This constituted the Buddhist Dharma,
which was ultimately collected in certain sacred books
to be next described.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c8">LECTURE III.
<br /><i>The Law (Dharma) and Sacred Scriptures of Buddhism.</i></h2>
<p>Probably most educated persons are aware that Buddhists
have their own sacred scriptures, like Hind&#363;s,
P&#257;rs&#299;s, Confucianists, Muhammadans, Jews, and Christians.
It is not, however, so generally known that in
one important particular these Buddhist scriptures, constituting
the Tri-pi&#7789;aka (<a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>), differ wholly from other
sacred books. They lay no claim to supernatural inspiration.
Whatever doctrine is found in them was
believed to be purely human&mdash;that is, was held to be
the product of man&rsquo;s own natural faculties working
naturally.</p>
<p>The Tri-pi&#7789;aka was never like the Veda of the Br&#257;hmans,
believed to be the very &lsquo;breath of God&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a>; the same
care, therefore, was not taken to preserve every sound;
and when at last it was written down the result was
a more scholastic production than the Veda.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was not composed in the Sansk&#7771;it of
the Veda and &#7776;&#257;stras&mdash;in the sacred language, the very
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
grammar and alphabet of which were supposed to come
from heaven&mdash;but in the vernacular of the part of
India in which Buddhism flourished. Indeed, it is a
significant fact that while the great sages of Sansk&#7771;it
literature and philosophy, such as Vy&#257;sa, Kum&#257;rila, and
&#7776;a&#7749;kara, in all probability spoke and taught in Sansk&#7771;it<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a>,
the Founder of Buddhism preferred to communicate his
precepts to the people in their own vernacular, afterwards
called P&#257;li. Nevertheless, he never composed a single
book of his own. In all probability he never wrote
down any of his own precepts; for if writing was then
invented, it was little practised, through the absence of
suitable materials. This is the more remarkable as
Buddhism ultimately became an instrument for introducing
literary culture among uncivilized races.</p>
<p>All that Gautama did was to preach his Dharma, &lsquo;Law,&rsquo;
during forty-five years of itineration, and oral teaching.
It was not till some time after his death that his sayings
were collected (<a href="#Page_97">p. 97</a>), and still longer before they
were written down. Itineration, recitation of the Law,
and preaching were the chief instruments for the propagation
of Buddhism.</p>
<p>At present the Buddhist Canon is about as extensive
as the Br&#257;hmanical<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a>, and in both cases we are left in
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
doubt as to the date when the books were composed.
How, then, did their composition take place?</p>
<p>All that can be said is that at three successive
epochs after the Buddha&rsquo;s death, three gatherings of
his followers were held for the purpose of collecting his
sayings and settling the true Canon, and that a fourth
assembly took place much later in the North.</p>
<p>The first of these assemblages can scarcely with any
fitness be called a Council. Nor can the fact of its
meeting together in any formal manner be established
on any trustworthy historical basis. It is said that a
number of monks (about five hundred, called Mah&#257;-sthavir&#257;&#7717;,
&lsquo;the great elders,&rsquo; P&#257;li Mah&#257;-ther&#257;) assembled
in a cave called Sattapa&#7751;&#7751;i, near the then capital city of
Magadha&mdash;R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha, now R&#257;j-g&#299;r&mdash;under the sanction
of king Aj&#257;ta-&#7777;atru, during the rainy season immediately
succeeding the death of Gautama, to think over, put
together, and arrange the sayings of their Master, but
not, so far as we know, to write them down.</p>
<p>There, in all likelihood, they made the first step
towards a methodical arrangement. But even then it
is doubtful whether any systematic collections were
composed. The assembled monks chose K&#257;&#7777;yapa (or
Mah&#257;-k&#257;&#7777;yapa, <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>), the most esteemed of all the
Buddha&rsquo;s surviving disciples, as their leader, and chanted
the Thera-v&#257;da (Sthavira-v&deg;), &lsquo;words of the elders,&rsquo; or
precepts of their Founder preserved in the memory of
the older men; the rules of discipline (Vinaya) being
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
recited by Up&#257;li<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>, and the ethical precepts (S&#363;tra), which
constituted at first the principal Dharma<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> (<i>par excellence</i>,
in contradistinction to the Vinaya), being imparted by
Gautama&rsquo;s favorite &#256;nanda (<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>); while the philosophical
doctrines&mdash;then undeveloped&mdash;were communicated
by the president, K&#257;&#7777;yapa. If any arrangement
was then made it was probably in two collections&mdash;the
Vinaya and Dharma (say about 400 <span class="small">B.C.</span>)</p>
<p>In regard to the Dharma, two main lines were,
in all likelihood, laid down as the basis of all early
teaching. The first consisted of the four sublime verities,
as they are called&mdash;that is, of the four fundamental
truths originally taught by the Founder of Buddhism,
namely, the inevitable inherence of suffering in every
form of life, the connexion of all suffering with indulgence
of desires, especially with craving for continuity
of existence, the possibility of the cessation of suffering
by restraining lusts and desires, and the eightfold
course leading to that cessation (see <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>).</p>
<p>The second line of doctrine probably consisted of an
outline of the twelve-linked chain of causality (nid&#257;na),
which traced back all suffering to a still deeper origin than
mere lusts and desires&mdash;namely, to ignorance (<a href="#Page_103">p. 103</a>).</p>
<p>It is not, however, at all likely that any philosophical
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
or metaphysical doctrines were clearly and methodically
formulated at the earliest assembly which took place
soon after Gautama&rsquo;s death. It is far more probable
that the first outcome of the gathering together of the
Buddha&rsquo;s disciples was simply the enforcing of some
strict rules of discipline for the Order of monks, and
this may have taken place soon after 400 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>
<p>After a time, certain relaxations of these rules or
unauthorized departures from them (ten in number,
such as reception of money-gifts, eating a second meal
in the afternoon, drinking stimulating beverages, if pure
as water in appearance<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a>), began to be common. The
question as to whether liberty should be allowed in
these points, <i>especially in the first</i>, shook the very foundations
of the community. In fact the whole society became
split up into two contending parties, the strict and
the lax, and a second Council became necessary for the
restoration of order. All ten points were discussed at
this Council, said to have consisted of 700 monks and
held at Vai&#7777;&#257;l&#299; (Ves&#257;l&#299;, now Bes&#257;rh), 27 miles north of
Patn&#257;, about 380 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> The discussions were protracted
for eight months, and all the ten unlawful relaxations
were finally prohibited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>It has been observed that this second Council stands
in a relation to Buddhism very similar to that which
the Council of Nic&aelig;a bears to Christianity.</p>
<p>The exact date, however, of either the first or second
assemblies cannot be determined with precision.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards occurred the political revolution
caused by the well-known &#262;andra-gupta (= Sandra-kottus)&mdash;sometimes
called the first A&#7777;oka (or disparagingly,
K&#257;l&#257;&#7777;oka). This man, who was a low-born &#7776;&#363;dra,
usurped the throne and founded the Maurya dynasty,
after killing king Nanda and taking possession of
P&#257;&#7789;aliputra (or Palibothra, now Patn&#257;, the then metropolis
of Magadha or Beh&#257;r), about 315 <span class="small">B.C.</span> He
extended the kingdom of Magadha over all Hind&#363;st&#257;n,
and became so powerful that when Alexander&rsquo;s successor,
Seleukos Nikator (whose reign commenced about 312
<span class="small">B.C.</span>), invaded India from his kingdom of Bactria, so
effectual was the resistance offered by &#262;andra-gupta,
that the Greek thought it politic to form an alliance
with the Hind&#363; king, and sent his own countryman,
Megasthenes, as an ambassador to reside at his court.</p>
<p>To this circumstance we owe the earliest authentic
account of Indian customs and usages, by an intelligent
observer who was not a native; and Megasthenes&rsquo;
narrative, preserved by Strabo, furnishes a basis on
which a fair inference may be founded that Br&#257;hmanism
and Buddhism existed side by side in India
on amicable terms in the fourth and third centuries <span class="small">B.C.</span>
There is even ground for believing that king &#262;andra-gupta
himself favoured the Buddhists, though outwardly
he never renounced his faith in Br&#257;hmanism.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&#262;andra-gupta&rsquo;s reign is thought to have lasted until
291 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and that of his son and successor, Vindus&#257;ra,
from 291 to (say) about 260 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Then came &#262;andra-gupta&rsquo;s
grandson, the celebrated A&#7777;oka (sometimes
called Dharm&#257;&#7777;oka), who, though of &#7776;&#363;dra origin, was
perhaps the greatest Hind&#363; monarch of India.</p>
<p>It was about this period that Gautama Buddha&rsquo;s
followers began to develope his doctrines, and to make
additions to them in such a way that the Abhi-dharma
or &lsquo;further Dharma&rsquo; had to be added to the &#7776;&#363;tra
which constituted the original Dharma (<a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>). Even
in Gautama&rsquo;s time there were great dissensions.
Afterwards differences of opinion increased, so that
before long eighteen schools of schismatic thought
(<a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>) were established. The resulting controversies
were very disturbing, and a third Council became
necessary. It consisted of a thousand oldest members
of the Order, and was held in the 16th or 17th year of
A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s reign at Patn&#257; (P&#257;&#7789;ali-putra), about 244-242 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>
<p>This third Council was, perhaps, the most important;
for through its deliberations the decision was arrived
at to propagate Buddhism by missions. Hence missionaries,
supported by king A&#7777;oka (see <a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>), were sent
in all directions; the first being Mahinda (Mahendra),
the king&rsquo;s son, who carried the doctrine into Ceylon.</p>
<p>Dr. Oldenberg has shown that in a part of the
Tri-pi&#7789;aka now extant, the first and second Councils
are mentioned but not the third. The plain inference
is that the portion of the Buddhist Canon in which
the second Council is described cannot be older than
that Council. Yet in all likelihood a great part of
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
the Vinaya (including the P&#257;timokkha and the Khandhaka,
<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>) was composed before the second Council&mdash;possibly
as early as about 400 <span class="small">B.C.</span>&mdash;and the rest of
the Canon during the succeeding century and a half
before the third Council&mdash;that is, from 400 to 250 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
It was composed in the then vernacular language of
Magadha (M&#257;gadh&#299;), where all three Councils were held.</p>
<p>It seems, however, probable that in each district to
which Buddhism spread the doctrine of its founder
was taught in the peculiar dialect understood by the
inhabitants. It even appears likely that when Gautama
himself lived in Kosala (Oudh) he preached in
the dialect of that province just as he taught in
M&#257;gadh&#299; when he resided in Magadha. The &#262;ulla-vagga
(V. 33. I) makes him direct that his precepts
should be learnt by every convert in the provincial
dialect, which doubtless varied slightly everywhere.
In time it became necessary to give fixity to the sacred
texts, and the form they finally assumed may have
represented the prevalent dialect of the time, and not
necessarily the original M&#257;gadh&#299; Pr&#257;k&#7771;it<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a>. This final
form of the language was called P&#257;li<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> (or Tanti), and no
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
doubt differs from the earlier A&#7777;oka inscription dialect,
and from M&#257;gadh&#299; Pr&#257;k&#7771;it as now known.</p>
<p>Some think that the P&#257;li resulted from an artificial
infusion of Sansk&#7771;it. It is said that nearly two-fifths of
the P&#257;li vocabulary consists of unmodified Sansk&#7771;it.</p>
<p>At any rate, it was in this language that the Buddhist
Law was carried (probably by Mahendra) into Ceylon,
and the whole Canon is thought by some to have been
handed down orally till it was written down there about
85 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Oral transmission, we know, was common in
India, but if edicts were written by A&#7777;oka (<a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>), why
should not the Law have been written down also?</p>
<p>As, however, P&#257;li was not spoken in Ceylon, the P&#257;li
commentaries brought by Mahendra were translated
by him into Sinhalese, and the P&#257;li originals being
lost, were not retranslated into P&#257;li till about the
beginning of the fifth century of our era.</p>
<p>Turning next to the final arrangement of the P&#257;li
Canon, we find that it resolved itself into three collections
(called Tri-pi&#7789;aka, P&#257;li Tipi&#7789;aka, &lsquo;Three baskets,&rsquo;
the word pi&#7789;aka, however, not occurring in the early
texts), namely: 1. Yinaya, &lsquo;discipline&rsquo; for the Order;
2. S&#363;tra-(P&#257;li Sutta), &lsquo;precepts,&rsquo; which at first constituted
the principal Dharma, or moral Law (<a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>); 3.
Abhi-dharma (Abhi-dhamma), &lsquo;further Dharma,&rsquo; or additional
precepts relative to the law and philosophy.</p>
<p>This division was not logical, as each collection may
treat of the subjects belonging to the others.</p>
<p>Taking, then, in the first place, the Vinaya or discipline
portion of the Buddhist bible, we ought to
observe that a portion of it (the P&#257;timokkha) is not only
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
the oldest, but also the most important in its bearing
on the whole theory of Buddhism. For, as we shall
point out more fully hereafter, the Buddha&rsquo;s paramount
aim was to convince others that to get rid of ignorance,
gain knowledge, practise morality, and obtain deliverance,
it was incumbent on a wise man to renounce
married life and become a member of a monastic Order.</p>
<p>Pure Buddhism, in fact, was pure monachism&mdash;implying
celibacy, poverty, and mendicancy&mdash;and this could
not be maintained without rules for discipline and outward
conduct, which, as adopted by the Buddha, were
simply a modification of the rules for the two religious
orders of the Brahma-&#263;&#257;r&#299; and Sanny&#257;s&#299;, already existing
in Br&#257;hmanism.</p>
<p>With regard to the classification of the Vinaya rules,
they were divided into three sets: <i>a.</i> the Khandhaka,
in two collections called Mah&#257;-vagga (Mah&#257;-varga),
&lsquo;great section,&rsquo; and &#262;ulla-vagga, &lsquo;minor section&rsquo; (vagga
= varga); <i>b.</i> the Vibha&#7749;ga (including the two works
called P&#257;r&#257;jika and P&#257;&#263;ittiya), or a systematic arrangement
and explanation of certain ancient &lsquo;release-precepts&rsquo;
(pratimoksha-s&#363;tra, P&#257;li P&#257;timokkha) for setting
free, through penances, any who had offended against
the Order; <i>c.</i> Pariv&#257;ra-p&#257;&#7789;ha, or a comparatively modern
summary of the above two divisions.</p>
<p>Mark, however, that the Vinaya abounds in details
of the life and teaching of Gautama.</p>
<p>The second Pi&#7789;aka, called Sutta (S&#363;tra), &lsquo;precepts,&rsquo;
contains the ethical doctrines which at first constituted
the whole Buddhist Law. It consists of five Nik&#257;yas,
or collections, viz. <i>a.</i> the D&#299;gha, or collection of 34 long
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
suttas, among which is the Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na-sutta (one
of the oldest parts of the Canon after the P&#257;timokkha);
<i>b.</i> the Majjhima, or collection of 152 suttas of middling
length; <i>c.</i> the Sa&#7747;yutta, or collection of 55 groups of
joined suttas, some of them very short; <i>d.</i> the A&#7749;guttara,
or miscellaneous suttas in divisions, which go on
increasing by one (a&#7749;ga); <i>e.</i> the Khuddaka, or minor
collection, consisting of fifteen works.</p>
<p>According to one school, this fifth Nik&#257;ya is more correctly
referred to the Abhi-dhamma Pi&#7789;aka. In character,
however, it conforms more to the Sutta. Of its fifteen
works, perhaps the most important are the following six:&mdash;</p>
<p>The Khuddaka-p&#257;&#7789;ha, &lsquo;short readings;&rsquo; the Dhamma-pada,
&lsquo;precepts of the Law&rsquo; (or &lsquo;verses of the Law,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;footsteps of the Law&rsquo;); the J&#257;taka (with their commentaries),
a series of stories relating to about 550<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> previous
births of the Buddha (<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>), which have formed the
basis of many stories in the Pa&ntilde;&#263;a-tantra, fables of &AElig;sop,
etc.; the Sutta-nip&#257;ta, &lsquo;collection of discourses;&rsquo; the
Thera-g&#257;th&#257; ( = Sthavira-g&deg;), &lsquo;verses or stanzas by elder
monks;&rsquo; Ther&#299;-g&#257;th&#257;, &lsquo;verses by elder nuns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other nine are the Ud&#257;na, containing 82 short
suttas and joyous utterances of the Buddha at crises
of his life; the Itivuttaka, &lsquo;thus it was said&rsquo; ( = ity
ukta), 110 sayings of the Buddha; the Vim&#257;na-vatthu,
on the mansions of the gods (which move about at will
and sometimes descend on earth); the Peta-vatthu
( = Preta-vastu, Peta standing for Preta and Pit&#7771;i),
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
on departed spirits; the Niddesa, a commentary on
the Sutta-nip&#257;ta; the Pa&#7789;i-sambhid&#257;, on the supernatural
knowledge of Arhats; the Apad&#257;na (Sansk&#7771;it
Avad&#257;na), &lsquo;stories about the achievements&rsquo; of Arhats;
the Buddha-va&#7753;sa, or history of the 24 preceding Buddhas
(the D&#299;gha mentions only six) and of Gautama;
the &#262;ariy&#257;-pi&#7789;aka, &lsquo;treasury of acts,&rsquo; giving stories based
on the J&#257;takas, describing Gautama&rsquo;s acquisition of the
ten transcendent virtues (<a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>) in former births.</p>
<p>The works included in this Sutta-pi&#7789;aka frequently
take the form of conversations on doctrine and morality,
between Gautama, or one of his chief disciples, and some
inquirer. As constituting the ethical Dharma, they are
the most interesting portion of the Canon.</p>
<p>With regard to the third Pi&#7789;aka, called Abhi-dhamma
(Abbhi-dharma, &lsquo;further dharma&rsquo;), which is held by
modern scholars to be of later origin and supplementary
to the Sutta (<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>), it contains seven prose
works<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a>.
Moreover, it was once thought to relate entirely
to metaphysics and philosophy; but this is now
held to be an error, for all seven works treat of a great
variety of subjects, including discipline and ethics. Metaphysical
discussions occur, but it is probable that originally
Buddha kept clear of metaphysics (see <a href="#Page_98">p. 98</a>).</p>
<p>Besides the numerous works we have thus described
as constituting the Tri-pi&#7789;aka or three collections of
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
works of the Southern Buddhists, there are the P&#257;li
commentaries called A&#7789;&#7789;ha-kath&#257; (Artha-kath&#257;, &lsquo;telling
of meanings<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a>&rsquo;), which were translated into Sinhalese,
according to tradition, by Mahendra himself. Afterwards
the original P&#257;li text was lost and some of the commentaries
were retranslated into P&#257;li by Buddha-ghosha,
&lsquo;he who had the very voice of Buddha,&rsquo; at the end of the
fourth and beginning of the fifth century of our era.</p>
<p>The Mah&#257;-va&#7753;&#7777;a or &lsquo;history of the great families of
Ceylon,&rsquo; a well-known work (written in P&#257;li by a monk
named Mah&#257;-n&#257;ma in the fifth century and translated
by Turnour), gives an account of this writer<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a>. It says
that a Br&#257;hman youth, born near Buddha-Gay&#257; in
Magadha, had achieved great celebrity as a disputant
in Br&#257;hmanical philosophy. This youth was converted
by a Buddhist sage in India, and induced to enter the
Buddhist monastic Order. He soon became renowned
for his eloquence, and was on that account called
Buddha-ghosha. He wrote a commentary, called A&#7789;&#7789;ha-s&#257;lin&#299;,
on the Dhamma-sa&#7749;gani, a work belonging to
the Abhi-dharma. He also wrote a most valuable P&#257;li
compendium of Buddhist doctrine called Visuddhi-magga,
&lsquo;path of purity,&rsquo; and a commentary on the
Dharma-pada containing many parables. He went to
Ceylon about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 430 for the purpose of retranslating
the Sinhalese commentaries into P&#257;li. His literary
reputation stands very high in that island, and he was
instrumental in spreading Buddhism throughout Burma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>It may be noted that the two important P&#257;li works,
Mah&#257;-va&#7753;&#7777;a and D&#299;pa-va&#7753;&#7777;a (Dv&#299;pa-va&#7753;&#7777;a), perhaps the
oldest extant histories of Ceylon, are also fairly
authentic sources for Buddhistic history before Christ.</p>
<p>Turn we now to the Mah&#257;y&#257;na or &lsquo;Great Vehicle.&rsquo;
This cannot be said to possess any true Canon distinct
from the Tri-pi&#7789;aka, though certain Nepalese Sansk&#7771;it
works, composed in later times, are held to be canonical
by Northern Buddhists.</p>
<p>To understand this part of the subject we must
revert to the great king A&#7777;oka. It is usual to call this
second and more celebrated A&#7777;oka the Constantine of
Buddhism. Being of &#7776;&#363;dra origin he was the more
inclined to favour the popular teaching of Gautama,
and, as he was the first king who adopted Buddhism
openly (about 257 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) he doubtless did for Buddhism
very much what Constantine did for Christianity.</p>
<p>The Buddhist system then spread over the whole
kingdom of A&#7777;oka, and thence over other portions of
India, and even to some outlying countries. For gradually
during this period most of the petty princes of
India, from Pesh&#257;war and Kashm&#299;r to the river Kistna,
and from Surat to Bengal and Orissa, if not actually
brought under subjection to the king of Magadha, were
compelled to acknowledge his paramount authority.</p>
<p>This is proved by A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s edicts, which are inscribed
on rocks and stone pillars<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> (the earliest dating from
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
about 251 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), and are found in frontier districts
separated from each other by enormous distances.</p>
<p>These inscriptions are of the greatest interest and
value, as furnishing the first authentic records of Indian
history. They are written in a more ancient language
than the P&#257;li of Ceylon, and in at least three different
dialects. Ten of the most important are found on six
rocks and five pillars (L&#257;&#7789;s), though numerous other
monuments are scattered over Northern India, from the
Indian Ocean to the Bay of Bengal, from the Vindhya
range on the south to the Khaibar Pass on the north<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>In these proclamations and edicts (one of which was
addressed to the third Buddhist Council), king A&#7777;oka,
who calls himself Priya-dar&#7777;&#299; (P&#257;li Piya-dass&#299;), issues
various orders. He prohibits the slaughter of animals
for food or sacrifice, gives directions for what may be
called the first hospitals, i. e. for treating men and even
animals medically, appoints missionaries for the propagation
of Buddhist doctrines, inculcates peace and
mercy, charity and toleration, morality and self-denial,
and what is still more remarkable, enjoins quinquennial
periods of national humiliation and confession of sins
by all classes, accompanied by a re-proclamation of the
Buddha&rsquo;s precepts. A&#7777;oka, in fact, became so zealous a
friend of Buddhism, that he is said to have maintained
64,000 Buddhist monks in and around the country of
Magadha, which was on that account called the land
of monasteries (Vih&#257;ra = the modern Bih&#257;r or Beh&#257;r).</p>
<p>No doubt it was A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s propagation of Buddhism
by missions in various countries&mdash;where it came in
contact with and partly adopted various already existing
indigenous faiths and superstitions&mdash;that led to the
ultimate separation of the Buddhist system into the
two great divisions of Southern and Northern.</p>
<p>Indeed, the formation of a Northern School, as distinct
from a Southern, became inevitable after the conversion
of Kanishka, the Indo-Scythian king of Kashm&#299;r, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
came from the North, and became a zealous Buddhist.
He probably reigned in the second half of the first
century (<span class="small">A.D.</span>), and extended his dominions as far as
Gujar&#257;t, Sindh, and even Mathur&#257; (see <a href="#fn_67">p. 167, note 2</a>).</p>
<p>It was during Kanishka&rsquo;s reign that a fourth Council<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a>
was held at J&#257;landhara in Kashm&#299;r, under P&#257;r&#7777;va and
Vasu-mitra. It consisted of 500 monks, who composed
three Sansk&#7771;it works of the nature of commentaries
(Upade&#7777;a, Vinaya-vibh&#257;sh&#257;, Abhidharma-vibh&#257;sh&#257;) on
the three P&#257;li Pi&#7789;akas. These were the earliest books
of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na or Northern School, which afterwards
formulated its more developed doctrines on the Indus,
while the P&#257;li Canon of the South represented the true
doctrine promulgated on the Ganges.</p>
<p>Kashm&#299;r was a centre of Sansk&#7771;it learning, and Kanishka,
who was a patron of it, became to Northern
Buddhism what A&#7777;oka had been to Southern. Hence
in process of time other Northern Buddhist books were
written in Sansk&#7771;it, with occasional G&#257;th&#257;s or stanzas
in an irregular dialect, half Sansk&#7771;it, half Pr&#257;k&#7771;it.</p>
<p>It is usual to enumerate nine Nepalese canonical
scriptures (Dharmas):&mdash;1.Praj&ntilde;&#257; p&#257;ramit&#257;, &lsquo;transcendent
knowledge,&rsquo; or an abstract of metaphysical and
mystic philosophy; 2. Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-vy&#363;ha;
3. Da&#7777;a-bh&#363;m&#299;&#7777;-vara
(describing the ten stages leading to Buddhahood);
4. Sam&#257;dhi-r&#257;ja; 5. La&#7749;k&#257;vat&#257;ra;
6. Saddharma-pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka,
&lsquo;Lotus of the True Law;&rsquo;
7. Tath&#257;ga&#7789;a-guhyaka
(containing the secret Tantric doctrines);
8. Lalita-vistara (giving a legendary life of Buddha);
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
9. Suvar&#7751;a-prabh&#257;sa. The eighth is probably as old as
the 2nd century of our era, and next comes the sixth.
Tibetan translations were made of all of them. These
extend to 100 volumes and are collectively called
Ka&rsquo;gyur or Kan&rsquo;gyur (Kanjur). We owe our knowledge
of these to the indefatigable Hungarian traveller, Alexander
Csoma de K&ouml;r&ouml;s.</p>
<p>Copies of the Sanskrit works were brought to England
by Mr. B. H. Hodgson. The sixth has been translated
by Burnouf and recently by H. Kern. Dr. R&#257;jendral&#257;la-mitra
has edited the eighth. As to the non-canonical
works M. Senart has edited part of the Mah&#257;-vastu,
and Professor E. B. Cowell and Mr. R. A. Neil,
the Divy&#257;vad&#257;na. They contain interesting old legends&mdash;some
about the achievements of A&#7777;oka, some about
Buddha himself, some perhaps from lost Vinaya books.</p>
<p>As to the P&#257;li written character, it is a question
whether that current in the holy land of Buddhism, or
in Ceylon, or in Siam (Kambodia), or in Burma&mdash;that
is, Devan&#257;gar&#299;, Sinhalese, Kambodian, or Burmese&mdash;should
be used. Many think Burmese most suited to
it, and in Europe the Roman character is preferred.</p>
<p>It should be added that the recitation (Bh&#257;&#7751;a,
Sansk&#7771;it root Bha&#7751;, &lsquo;to speak;&rsquo; in Sinhalese spelt Ba&#7751;a)
of the Law is one of the principal duties of monks, the
reciter being called Bh&#257;&#7751;aka. A peculiar mode of
intoning is called Sara-bha&ntilde;&ntilde;a (sara = svara). The
Buddha, they say, is not extinct, for he lives in the
Dharma and in the Sa&#7749;gha, in the Law and in the
monks who recite it. Hence the importance of recitation
in the Buddhist system (<a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c9">LECTURE IV.
<br /><i>The Sa&#7749;gha or Buddhist Order of Monks.</i></h2>
<p>Perhaps the first point made clear by the study
of the Buddhist Scriptures is, that the Buddha never
seriously thought of founding a new system in direct
opposition to Br&#257;hmanism and caste. Even his Order
or fraternity of Monks, which attained a world-wide
celebrity and spread through a great part of Asia, was
a mere imitation of an institution already established
in India. He himself was a Hind&#363; of the Hind&#363;s,
and he remained a Hind&#363; to the end. His very name,
Gautama, connected him with one of the most celebrated
Hind&#363; sages, and was significant of his original
connexion with orthodox Br&#257;hmanism. It is true he
was a determined opponent of all Br&#257;hmanical sacerdotalism
and ceremonialism, and of all theories about
the supernatural character of the Vedas (see <a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>); but,
being himself a Hind&#363;, he never required his adherents
to make any formal renunciation of Hind&#363;ism, as if
they had been converted to an entirely new faith; just
as, if I may say so with all reverence, the Founder
of the Christian Church, being Himself a Jew, never
required His followers to give up every Jewish usage.</p>
<p>Nor had the Buddha any idea of courting popularity
as a champion of social equality and denouncer
of all distinctions of rank and ancient traditions&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
kind of Tribune of the people, whose mission was to
protect them from the tyranny of the upper classes.</p>
<p>There was, no doubt, at one time a prevalent opinion
among scholars that Gautama aimed at becoming a great
social reformer. It was generally supposed that he
began by posing before his fellow-countrymen in a somewhat
<i>ad captandum</i> manner as a popular leader and
liberator, whose mission was to deliver them from the
tyranny of caste. But such an opinion is now known
to be based on mistaken assumptions. What ought
rather to be claimed for him is that he was the first to
establish a universal brotherhood (Sa&#7749;gha) of c&oelig;nobite
monks, open to all persons of all ranks. In other
words, he was the first founder of what may be called
a kind of universal monastic communism (for Buddhist
monks never, as a rule, lived alone), and the first to
affirm that true enlightenment&mdash;the knowledge of the
highest path leading to saintship&mdash;was not confined to
the Br&#257;hmans, but open to all the members of all castes.
This was the only sense in which he abolished caste.
His true followers, however, constituted a caste of their
own, distinguished from the laity. From the want of a
more suitable term we are forced to call them &lsquo;monks<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And this Order of monks was not a hierarchy. It
had no ecclesiastical organization under any centralized
authority. Its first Head, Gautama, appointed no successor.
It was not the depository of theological learning.
Nor was it a mediatorial caste of priests, claiming to
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
mediate between earth and heaven. It ought not to
be called a Church, and it had no rite of ordination in
the true sense. It was a brotherhood, in which all were
under certain obligations of celibacy, moral restraint,
fasting, poverty, itineration and confession to each other&mdash;all
were dominated by one idea, and pledged to the
propagation of the one doctrine, that all life was in itself
misery, and to be got rid of by a long course of discipline,
as not worth living, whether on earth or in heaven,
whether in present or future bodies. The founding of
a monastic brotherhood of this kind which made personal
extinction its final aim, and might be co-extensive with
the whole world, was the Buddha&rsquo;s principal object.</p>
<p>In point of fact, the so-called enlightenment of mind
which entitled him to Buddhahood, led him at the early
stage of his career into no abstruse or transcendental
region of thought, but took a very practical direction.
It led him to see that an association of monks offering
equality of condition to high and low, rich and poor,
and a haven of refuge to all oppressed by the troubles
of life, would soon become popular. His Order started
with first ten, then fifty, then sixty original members
(see <a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>), but its growth soon surpassed all anticipations,
and its ramifications extended to distant countries,
where, like the branches of the Indian fig-tree, they
sent down roots to form vigorous independent plants,
even after the decay of the parent stem. On this
account it was called the fraternity of the four quarters
(&#262;&#257;tuddisa, Mah&#257;-vagga VIII. 27. 5) of the globe.</p>
<p>In brief, a carefully regulated monastic brotherhood,
which opened its arms to all comers of all ranks, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
enforced on its members the duty of extending its
boundaries by itinerancy, and by constantly rolling
onward the wheel of the true doctrine (Law), constituted
in its earliest days the very essence, the very backbone
of Buddhism, without which it could never have been
propagated, nor even have held its own.</p>
<p>But we repeat that in this, his main design, Gautama
was after all no innovator; no introducer of novel ideas.</p>
<p>Monachism had always been a favourite adjunct of
the Br&#257;hminanical system, and respect for monastic life
had taken deep root among the people. Thus we find
it laid down in its most authoritative exponent, Manu&rsquo;s
Law-book (Book VI), that every twice-born man was
bound to be first an unmarried student (Brahma-&#263;&#257;r&#299;),
next a married householder, and then at the end of a
long life he was to abandon wife and family and become
a Sanny&#257;s&#299;, &lsquo;ascetic,&rsquo; or Bhikshu, &lsquo;mendicant,&rsquo;
wandering from door to door. In fact, it was through
these very states of life that Gautama himself, as a
Kshatriya, was theoretically bound to have passed.</p>
<p>Hind&#363; monks, therefore, were numerous before Buddhism.
They belonged to various sects, and took various
vows of self-torture, of silence, of fasting, of poverty, of
mendicancy, of celibacy, of abandoning caste, rank, wife
and family. Accordingly they had various names. The
Br&#257;hman was called a Sanny&#257;s&#299;, &lsquo;one who gives up the
world.&rsquo; Others were called Vair&#257;g&#299;, &lsquo;free from affections;&rsquo;
Yog&#299;, &lsquo;seeking mystic union with the Deity;&rsquo;
Dig-ambara, &lsquo;sky-clothed,&rsquo; &lsquo;naked;&rsquo; Tapasv&#299;, &lsquo;practising
austerities;&rsquo; Yati, &lsquo;restraining desires;&rsquo; Jitendriya,
&lsquo;conquering passions;&rsquo; &#7776;rama&#7751;a, &lsquo;undergoing discipline;&rsquo;
Bhikshu, &lsquo;living by alms;&rsquo; Nirgrantha, &lsquo;without ties.&rsquo;
Such names prove that asceticism was an ancient institution.
The peculiarity about Gautama&rsquo;s teaching in
regard to monachism was that he discouraged<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> solitary
asceticism, severe austerities, and irrevocable vows,
though he enjoined moral restraint in celibate fraternities,
conformity to rules of discipline, upright conduct,
and confession to each other.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>His usual mode of designating his monks was by the
old term Bhikshu (P&#257;li Bhikkhu), &lsquo;living by alms,&rsquo; to indicate
their poverty. They were also called &#7776;r&#257;ma&#7751;era
and &#7776;rama&#7751;a (P&#257;li S&#257;ma&#7751;era, Sama&#7751;a), as subject to
monastic discipline<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a>. Those who entered the stream
leading to Arhatship (<a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>) were called &#256;rya.</p>
<p>The term &#7776;r&#257;vaka, &lsquo;hearers,&rsquo; seems to have been used
in the H&#299;na-y&#257;na system to denote great disciples only,
and especially those &lsquo;great disciples&rsquo; (<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>) of Gautama
who heard the Law from his own lips, and were afterwards
called Sthaviras and became Arhats (<a href="#Page_133">p. 133</a>).
They had also the title &#256;yushmat, &lsquo;possessing life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We perceive again the close connexion between
Br&#257;hmanism and Buddhism; for clearly the Brahma-&#263;&#257;r&#299;
and Sanny&#257;s&#299; of the one became the &#7776;r&#257;ma&#7751;era or
junior monk, and &#7776;rama&#7751;a or senior monk of the other.</p>
<p>As to the name &#7776;rama&#7751;a (from root &#7776;ram, &lsquo;to toil&rsquo;),
bear in mind that, although Buddhism has acquired
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
the credit of being the easiest religious system in the
world, and its monks are among the idlest of men&mdash;as
having no laborious ceremonies and no work to do for a
livelihood&mdash;yet in reality the carrying out of the great
object of extinguishing lusts, and so getting rid of
the burden of repeated existences, was no sinecure if
earnestly undertaken. Nor was it possible for men
to lead sedentary lives, whose only mode of avoiding
starvation was by house to house itinerancy.</p>
<p>As to the form of admission, there was no great
strictness in early times, when all applicants were admitted
without inquiry. It was only when the Order
increased that murderers, robbers, debtors, soldiers and
others in the King&rsquo;s service, lepers, cripples, blind, one-eyed,
deaf and dumb, and consumptive persons, and all
subject to fits were rejected<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a>.</p>
<p>Originally it was enough for the Buddha to have
said, &lsquo;Come (ehi), follow me.&rsquo; This alone conferred
discipleship. In time, however, he commissioned those
he had himself admitted to admit others. Then the
form of admission to the brotherhood was divided into
two stages, marked by two ceremonies, which have
been very unsuitably compared to our ordination services
for deacon and priest. At any rate the term &lsquo;ordination&rsquo;
is wholly misleading, if any idea of a priestly commission
or gift of spiritual powers be implied.</p>
<p>The youthful layman who desired admission to the
first degree, or that of a novice, had to be at least
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
fifteen years old<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> (Mah&#257;-v&deg; I. 50); and such novices
had to be at least twenty (from conception) before the
second rite or admission to the full monkhood.</p>
<p>The first rite was called pravrajy&#257; (pabbajj&#257;), &lsquo;going
forth from home&rsquo; (Mah&#257;-v&deg; I. 12). Persons admitted
to this first degree of monkhood were called &#7776;r&#257;ma&#7751;era
(S&#257;manera), &lsquo;novices,&rsquo; though they were also called
&lsquo;new&rsquo; or &lsquo;junior monks&rsquo; (Navako Bhikkhu). They
might be admitted by a senior monk without appearing
before any formal conclave; but not without the consent
of their parents, and not without attaching themselves
to a religious teacher (up&#257;dhy&#257;ya) after their
admission. It is said that Gautama was urged by his
father &#7776;uddhodana to require the sanction of parents,
in rather touching and remarkable words, to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The love for a son cuts into the cuticle (&#263;havi);
having cut into the cuticle, it cuts into the inner skin
(&#263;amma); having cut into the inner skin, it cuts into
the flesh; having cut into the flesh, it cuts into the
tendons (nh&#257;ru or nah&#257;ru); having cut into the tendons,
it cuts into the bones; having cut into the bones, it
reaches the marrow (a&#7789;&#7789;hi-mi&#7749;j&#257;), and abides in the
marrow. Let not Pabbajj&#257;, therefore, be performed on
a son without his father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s permission&rsquo;
(Mah&#257;-vagga I. 54).</p>
<p>The admission ceremony of a novice was extremely
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
simple, and confined to certain acts and words on the
part of the candidate, witnessed by any competent monk.
The Sa&#7749;gha, as a body, took no part in it. The novice
first cut off his hair, put on three yellow ragged
garments (tri-&#263;&#299;vara), adjusted the upper robe so as
to leave the right shoulder bare, and then before a
monk repeated three times the three-refuge formula:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;I go for refuge to the Buddha (Buddha&#7747; &#7777;ara&#7751;a&#7747; ga&#263;&#263;h&#257;mi).&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;I go for refuge to the Law (Dharma&#7747; &#7777;ara&#7751;a&#7747; ga&#263;&#263;h&#257;mi).&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;I go for refuge to the Order (Sa&#7749;gha&#7747; &#7777;ara&#7751;a&#7747; ga&#263;&#263;h&#257;mi).&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Very remarkably, this, the only prayer of true Buddhism,
resembled the G&#257;yatr&#299; or sacred prayer of the
Veda (repeated by the Brahma-&#263;&#257;r&#299;) in consisting of
three times eight syllables. But if the Buddhist novice
had a right to the Brahma-&#263;&#257;r&#299;&rsquo;s sacred cord (upav&#299;ta),
this was probably abandoned on admission. He was
then instructed in the Ten Precepts (Dasa-s&#299;la or sikkh&#257;-pada),
which were really ten prohibitions (Mah&#257;-vagga
I. 56), requiring ten abstinences (verama&#7751;&#299;):&mdash;</p>
<p>1. from destroying life (p&#257;&#7751;&#257;tipato = pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;tip&#257;ta);
2. from taking anything not given (adinn&#257;d&#257;na); 3.
from unchastity (abrahma&#263;ariy&#257;); 4. from speaking
falsely (mus&#257;-v&#257;da = m&#7771;ish&#257;-v&#257;da); 5. from drinking
strong drinks (sur&#257;); 6. from eating at forbidden times
(vik&#257;la-bhojana); 7. from dancing, singing, music, and
worldly spectacles (vis&#363;ka); 8. from garlands, scents,
unguents or ornaments; 9. from the use of a high or
broad bed; 10. from receiving gold or silver. The
prohibition not to receive money, even in return for religious
teaching or any supposed spiritual benefits conferred,
was held to be most important, and was for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
long time obeyed, though in the end monasteries became
owners of large property and landed estates.</p>
<p>Of course the Upasampad&#257;, or admission to full
monkhood (described Mah&#257;-vagga I. 76), was a more
formal ceremony. A conclave (Sa&#7749;gha) of at least ten
monks was required. The candidate had to appear
before them, but was first instructed by some competent
and learned monk as to the nature of the rite and the
questions he would have to answer. This instructor
also directed him to choose some other monk competent
to act as his Up&#257;dhy&#257;ya (upajjh&#257;ya) or teacher for
five years after his admission, and made him provide
himself with an alms-bowl and with the usual yellow
monkish vestments. Then his first instructor presented
himself before the conclave and informed them that the
candidate was ready to be admitted. Thereupon the
novice came forward, adjusted his upper garment so as
to cover the left shoulder, bowed down before the feet
of the assembled monks, seated himself on the ground,
and, raising his joined hands, asked three times for
admission to the full monkhood, thus:&mdash;&lsquo;I entreat the
Sa&#7749;gha for full monkhood (Upasampad&#257;), have compassion
on me and uproot me (ullumpatu m&#257;m) from
the world,&rsquo; repeated thrice.</p>
<p>Thereupon he was questioned [not, as in our Ordination
Service: &lsquo;Are you inwardly moved by the Holy
Spirit to take upon you this office?&rsquo; Not: &lsquo;Will you
apply all your diligence to frame and fashion your own
life and that of your family so as to be wholesome
examples?&rsquo; but] thus:&mdash;Are you free from leprosy,
boils, consumption, fits, etc. Are you a male? Are
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
you a free man and not in the royal service? Are
you free from debts? Have you the consent of your
parents? Are you full twenty years old? Have you
an alms-bowl and vestments? What is your name?
What is your teacher&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>If the answers were satisfactory the candidate
was admitted. After admission no prayer was pronounced
[such as in our Ordination Service: &lsquo;We beseech
Thee, merciful Father, send on Thy servant
Thy heavenly blessing that he may be clothed with
righteousness&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a>]; but he was informed that he was to
trust to only four Resources (nissaya), and to abstain
from four chief forbidden acts (akara&#7751;&#299;y&#257;ni). These
four Resources and four Prohibitions were then communicated
to him thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>First the four Resources as follow:&mdash;(1) Broken
morsels given in alms for food; (2) Rags from a dust-heap
for clothes; (3) Roots of trees for an abode;
(4) Liquid putrefying excreta of cows for medicine.
Note, however, that, in practice, indulgences (atirekha-l&#257;bha)
were in all four cases allowed; such as, better
food when it happened to be given, or when invited to
dinner by rich laymen; linen, cotton, or woollen garments,
if dyed yellow and in three pieces (but only one
change was allowed); houses, huts, or caves to dwell
in, when not itinerating; ghee, honey, or molasses when
out of health (Mah&#257;-v&deg; I. 30. 4).</p>
<p>Next the four chief Prohibitions (compare the Ten
Prohibitions, <a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>), viz.:&mdash;(1) Unchastity and sexual acts
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
of any kind; (2) Taking anything not given, even a
blade of grass; (3) Killing any living thing, even an
ant, or worm, or plant; (4) Falsely claiming the extraordinary
powers of a perfected saint (uttarimanussa-dhamma.
Mah&#257;-v&deg; I. 78. 2).</p>
<p>Clearly there were great temptations to gain celebrity
by claiming such powers, or else this fourth prohibition
would not have terminated the ceremony.</p>
<p>So soon as a man was admitted to full monkhood, he
went through a five years&rsquo; course of instruction in the
entire doctrine and discipline, under the preceptor
(Up&#257;dhy&#257;ya, &#256;&#263;&#257;rya) who had been previously chosen
and was required to be of at least ten years&rsquo; standing.</p>
<p>This was a modification of the Br&#257;hmanical rule that
a student (Brahma-&#263;&#257;r&#299;) should study under his preceptor
for thirty-six years, or less, until he knew the Veda.</p>
<p>The full Buddhist monk had in theory to dwell
under trees or in huts formed of leaves (p&#257;&#7751;-s&#257;l&#257; =
pa&#7751;&#7751;a-s&#257;la = par&#7751;a-&#7777;&#257;l&#257;); but practically he resided in
collections of simple mud or brick tenements, in cells,
or in rows of caves hewn out of rocky hills. At any
rate, collections of monastic dwellings, called Vih&#257;ras<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a>,
were his usual abode during Vassa (or the rainy season,
see <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>); and at such times he had fellow-monks
(saddhivih&#257;rika) living in companies around him, or
in the same monastery.</p>
<p>Strict discipline was supposed to be enforced, and yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
there was no central authority, no Chief Hierarch, no
Archbishop whom he was bound &lsquo;reverently to obey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Offences against the four forbidden acts were called
P&#257;r&#257;jik&#257; &#257;patti, &lsquo;offences meriting expulsion from the
community of monks (Sa&#7749;gha).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then there were thirteen Sa&#7749;gh&#257;dises&#257; &#257;patti, as
well as certain Dukkata or less serious offences, requiring
only confession before the Sa&#7749;gha, and dealt
with by a Sa&#7749;gha-kamma, or act of a conclave of monks
imposing some penance. There were penances (Pr&#257;ya&#7777;-&#263;itta)
for lying, prevarication, abusive language, destroying
vegetable or animal life, etc. (see P&#257;timokkha,
P&#257;&#263;ittiy&#257; dhamm&#257;, and pp. <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, <a href="#Page_84">84</a>). The following
practices were also incumbent on all monks:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The wearing vestments given by laymen (not
purchased) and consisting of three lengths of yellow-coloured
rags; or, if entire lengths of cotton cloths were
given, the saleable value had to be destroyed by tearing
them into at least three pieces, and then sewing them
together; (2) The owning no possessions except the
three cloths, a girdle, bowl, razor, needle, and water-strainer
to prevent the swallowing of animalcul&aelig;;
(3) The living only on food collected in a wooden bowl
by daily going from house to house, but without ever
asking for it; (4) The eating at mid-day the one meal
so collected and at no other time; (5) The fasting on
four prescribed days; (6) The abiding in one spot for
three or four months during Vassa, &lsquo;the rains&rsquo; (from
middle of June to middle of October), when itineration
would involve trampling on vegetable and insect life;
(7) The refraining from a recumbent posture under all
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
circumstances; (8) The visiting cremation-grounds for
meditation on the corruption of the body.</p>
<p>In truth it might almost be said that in every
movement and action, in waking and sleeping, in
dressing and undressing, in standing and sitting, in
going out and coming in, in fasting and eating, in
speaking and not speaking, the Buddhist monk had
to submit to the most stringent regulations.</p>
<p>It was a noteworthy feature in Buddhist monachism
that monks were never allowed to appear in public in a
state of even semi-nudity. &lsquo;Properly clad,&rsquo; says the
Sekhiy&#257; dhamm&#257; (4), &lsquo;must the monk itinerate.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not
nakedness,&rsquo; says the Dhamma-pada (141), &lsquo;can purify
a mortal who has not overcome desires.&rsquo; The monk&rsquo;s
three garments (ti&#263;&#299;vara = tri-&#263;&#299;vara) were an inner
one (antara-v&#257;saka), another wound about the thighs
(sa&#7749;gh&#257;&#7789;&#299;) and an upper robe (uttar&#257;sa&#7749;ga) worn loosely
and brought round over the left shoulder. This constituted
an important distinction between the Buddhist
monks and the Jaina and other naked ascetics whose
want of decency the Buddha condemned.</p>
<p>The Buddhist monk&rsquo;s daily life probably began by
meditation and by his reciting or intoning (Bh&#257;&#7751;a, Sarabha&ntilde;&ntilde;a)
portions of the Law, or by hearing it recited,
followed perhaps by lessons in doctrine, or by discussions
or by confessions. Next came itineration for food, followed
by the one noon-day meal. Then came rest and
further meditation and recitation, while possibly the
senior monks preached to laymen. Such preaching took
place especially during Vassa. In later times the daily
duties included offering flowers, etc., at sacred shrines,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
and repeating so-called prayers, which were merely
forms of words used as charms.</p>
<p>To illustrate the immensely meritorious efficacy of
constant recitation of the Law, a story is told of five
hundred bats that lived in a cave where two monks
daily recited the Dharma. These bats gained such
merit by simply hearing the sound that when they died
they were all re-born as men and ultimately as gods.</p>
<p>Doubtless quarrels and faults of omission and commission
occurred among the monks, especially during their
residence together in Vassa (miscalled the Buddhist Lent).
We read of six monks named &#262;habbaggiya who were constantly
committing offences. Hence a day called Pav&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;
(Prav&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;), &lsquo;invitation,&rsquo; was kept at the end of
Vassa, when all were invited to assemble for confession
and for felicitation, if harmony had been preserved.</p>
<p>An important part of every monk&rsquo;s duties was confession
on Uposatha (Upavasatha) or fast-days (miscalled
the Buddhist sabbaths)&mdash;which were kept at first on two
days in each month, at full and new moon (corresponding
to the Dar&#7777;a and Paur&#7751;am&#257;sa days of Br&#257;hmanism),
and afterwards also at the intermediate days of quarter-moon.
On these four Uposatha days the P&#257;timokkha
or general confession (<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>) was recited. The confession
was by monks to each other, not by laymen to
monks, though the four days were also observed by
laymen, and we know that A&#7777;oka enjoined periodical
ceremonies, and expression of sorrow for sins on the
part of all his subjects. Such confession did not cause
remission of sin or absolution in our sense, but only
release from evil consequences by penances (<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>We have learnt, then, that Buddhist monks were not
under irrevocable vows. They undertook to obey rules
of discipline, but took no actual vows&mdash;not even of
obedience to a superior. Buddhist monkhood was purely
voluntary, so that all were free to come and go. It had
nothing hereditary about it like the rank of a Br&#257;hman.</p>
<p>We have also learnt, that the term &lsquo;priest&rsquo; is not
suitably applied to Buddhist monks. For true Buddhism
has no ecclesiastical hierarchy, no clergy, no
priestly ordination; no divine revelation, no ceremonial
rites, no prayer, no worship in the proper sense of these
terms. Each man was a priest to himself in so far as
he depended on himself alone for internal sanctification.</p>
<p>Evidently, too, all Buddhist monks were integral parts
of one organic whole. It is true that in the end they
were collected in various monasteries, each of which
practically became an independent Sa&#7749;gha (each under
one Head). But in theory all were parts of one and the
same brotherhood, which was republican and communistic
in its constitution. And this word Sa&#7749;gha cannot be
correctly rendered by &lsquo;church,&rsquo; if by that term is meant
an ecclesiastical body with legislative functions, embracing
clergy and <i>laity</i> united in a common faith and under
one Head; for as founded by the Buddha, it was not
this. It was simply a vast fraternity intended to embrace
all monks of the four quarters (&#263;aturdi&#7777;a) of the
world, from the Buddha himself and the perfected Arhat
(<a href="#Page_133">p. 133</a>), to every monk of the lowest degree, but not
a single layman. Indeed in its highest sense the Sa&#7749;gha
comprised only true Nirv&#257;&#7751;a-seeking monks who had
entered the paths of true sanctification (<a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>And here observe that, notwithstanding the stigma
attached to unmarried women in India, Gautama in the
end permitted an Order of Nuns (P&#257;li Bhikkhun&#299;) and
female novices (S&#257;ma&#7751;er&#299;, <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>). The &#262;ulla-vagga
(X. I. 3) relates how women were indebted to the
intercession of a monk, Gautama&rsquo;s cousin &#256;nanda, for
permission to form an Order, and how Mah&#257;-praj&#257;pat&#299;,
the Buddha&rsquo;s nurse (<a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>), became the first nun;
yet when &#256;nanda first asked: &lsquo;How are we monks to
behave when we see women?&rsquo; Gautama replied: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
see them.&rsquo; &lsquo;But if we should see them, what are we to
do?&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to them.&rsquo; &lsquo;But if they speak to us,
what then?&rsquo; &lsquo;Let your thoughts be fixed in deep
meditation&rsquo; (Sati upa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;petabb&#257;. Mah&#257;-parin&deg; V. 23).</p>
<p>Clearly the Buddha was originally a misogynist as
well as a misogamist, and wished his followers to be
misogynists also. Even when he had been induced to
admit the justice of the plea for women&rsquo;s rights, he
placed his nuns under the direction of monks. They
could only be admitted by monks, and were subject to
the male Order in all matters of discipline. They were
under eight special obligations, one of which was to
rise up in the presence of a monk, even if a novice.</p>
<p>The Buddha&rsquo;s exhortation to the first nun is noteworthy:&mdash;&lsquo;Whatsoever,
O Gotam&#299; (Mah&#257;-praj&#257;pat&#299;),
conduces to absence of passion, to absence of pride, to
wishing for little and not for much, to seclusion and not
to love of society, to earnest effort and not to indolence,
to contentment and not to querulousness, verily that is
the true doctrine&rsquo; (&#262;ulla-v&deg; X. 5).</p>
<p>It was certainly a great gain for a woman when she
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
was permitted to become a nun (or a Ther&#299;); for, as
a nun, she could even attain Arhatship. This is clearly
laid down in &#262;ulla-vagga X. 1. 3. 4. No woman, however,
could attain to Buddhahood without being born
as a man, so that it could scarcely be said that in
Buddha there is &lsquo;neither male nor female.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such, then, was the monachism which constituted the
very pith and marrow of Buddhism. All truly enlightened
disciples of Buddha were monks or nuns.</p>
<p>Let us not forget, however, that in practice Buddhism
admitted lay-brothers, lay-sisters, married householders
and working-men, as necessary adjuncts.</p>
<p>Yet they were only appendages. Of course the
Buddha knew very well that it was not possible to
enforce celibacy on all his followers. He knew
that having prohibited his monks from making or
taking money or holding property, they would have to
depend on lay-associates and householders for food,
clothing, and habitation, and that, if every layman were
to become a monk, there would be no work done, no
food produced, no children born, and in time no
humanity&mdash;nay, no Buddhism&mdash;left.</p>
<p>Universal monkhood, in short, might have been a consummation
to be aimed at in some Utopia; but was
practically unattainable. In fact Gautama had to take
the world as he found it, and the very idea of a world
perpetuating itself&mdash;according to his own theory of a
constant succession of birth, decay, and reproduction&mdash;implied
that a youth, on reaching manhood, married,
had children, worked and earned a livelihood for their
support. He could not impose this burden on others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Besides, the generality of people were in Gautama&rsquo;s
day what they are in India now-a-days&mdash;bent on early
marriage, and resolute in working hard for a livelihood.
Even Manu only enjoined celibacy on young religious
students and on old men, though there were occasional
cases of perpetual (naish&#7789;hika) Brahma-&#263;&#257;rins.</p>
<p>Without doubt, celibacy in instances of extraordinary
sanctity has always commanded respect in India; but
in no country of the world has married life been so
universally honoured. It is not very likely, then, that
the following sentiments, enunciated by the Buddha,
could have met with general approval:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wise man should avoid married life (abrahma-&#263;ariyam)
as if it were a burning pit of live coals&rsquo;
(Dhammika-Sutta 21).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Full of hindrances is married life, defiled by passion.
How can one who dwells at home live the higher
life in all its purity?&rsquo; (Tevijja-Sutta 47).</p>
<p>And in reality Buddha&rsquo;s anti-matrimonial doctrines
<i>did</i> excite opposition. The people murmured and said,
&lsquo;He is come to bring childlessness among us, and widowhood,
and destruction of family-life.&rsquo; Indeed, the two
facts&mdash;first, that the foundations of Buddhism were
not laid (as those of Christianity notably are), on the
hallowed hearth of home and on the sacred rock of
family-life with its daily round of honest work; and&mdash;secondly,
that the precept enjoining monkhood and
abstinence from marriage was not combined with any
organized ecclesiastical hierarchy under a central government,
are sufficient to account for the circumstance that
Buddhism never gained any real stability in India.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>No doubt lay-brethren were always welcomed; but
they were bound to Buddhism by very slender ties in
regard to dogma, and were only expected to conform
to the simplest possible code of morality.</p>
<p>Probably the only form of admission for a layman was
the repetition of the 24 syllables of the three-refuge
(tri-&#7777;ara&#7751;a) formula:&mdash;&lsquo;I go for refuge to the Buddha,
his Law and his Order&rsquo; (<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>). It was of course
understood that he was to abstain from the five gross
sins (<a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>), but he was already bound to do so by
the rules of Hind&#363; caste and family-religion. The
chief test of his Buddhism was his readiness to serve
the monks. It was for this reason, I think, that lay-adherents
were not called, as might have been expected,
&#7776;r&#257;vakas, &lsquo;Hearers,&rsquo; but simply Up&#257;sakas, &lsquo;Servers,&rsquo;
and in the case of women Up&#257;sik&#257;s. They could
not be called disciples of Buddha in the <i>truest sense</i>,
unless they entered his monastic Order.</p>
<p>Of course the majority of Buddhist householders
never cared to do this. Their chief religion consisted
in giving food and clothing, earned by daily toil, to the
monks<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a>. If they failed in this, there was only one
punishment. They were forbidden the privilege of
giving at all, and so of accumulating a store of merit.
No monk was allowed to ask them for a single thing.
Of course, too, the majority of Buddhist householders
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
were worldly-minded; they were no believers in ultra-pessimistic
views of life. They looked for a life in
some heaven, not Nirv&#257;&#7751;a. Yet in theory all laymen
might enter the paths of sanctification (<a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>), and
thousands of earnest men are said to have done so<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a>.</p>
<p>A layman&rsquo;s progress, however, towards Arhatship, except
through monkhood and abandoning the world, was
almost hopelessly barred. At page 264 of the Milinda-pa&ntilde;ha
it is implied that an earnest layman might become
an Arhat, even while still a layman, but he had
either to enter monkhood or else to pass away in
Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a (<a href="#Page_140">p. 140</a>) at the moment of becoming so.</p>
<p>The best proof of the truth of this view of the
matter is, that after a layman had attached himself
to the Buddha, the Law, and the Order, he was not
required to undergo any initiatory ceremony, like baptism,
or to receive any stamp of membership, or to
assume a peculiar dress, or to give up all belief in his
family religion, or caste-customs. In short, he did not
as a lay-brother break entirely with Hind&#363;ism.</p>
<p>That universal tolerance was of the very essence of
Buddhism is indicated by A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s twelfth edict:&mdash;&lsquo;The
beloved of the gods honours all forms of religious
faith&mdash;there ought to be reverence for one&rsquo;s own faith
and no reviling of that of others.&rsquo; Compare <a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>.</p>
<p>Nor did Gautama himself ever set an example of
intolerance. He never railed at the Br&#257;hmans. He
treated them with respect, and taught others to do so;
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
and even adopted the title Br&#257;hma&#7751;a for his own saints
and Arhats (Dhamma-pada 383-423).</p>
<p>What he opposed was priestcraft and superstition,
not Br&#257;hmanism; as indeed other reformers had done
before him. Probably the great receptivity of Buddhism
was one of the causes that led to its decay in India.</p>
<p>Yet Gautama&rsquo;s victory over one of the most inveterate
propensities in human nature&mdash;the tendency to seek
salvation through a mediatorial caste of priests&mdash;was a
wonderful achievement. This is proved by the fact
that his followers in other countries became re-entangled
in a network of priestcraft, even more enslaving
than that out of which he had rescued them.</p>
<p>Koeppen, Rhys Davids, and other writers have well
shown that the Buddhism of Tibet, with its Pope-like
grand L&#257;mas&mdash;its cardinals and abbots, monks and
mendicant friars, nuns and novices, canonized saints
and angelic hosts, temples and costly shrines, monasteries
and nunneries, images and pictures, altars and
relics, robes and mitres, rosaries and consecrated water,
litanies and chants, processions and pilgrimages, confessions
and penances, bell-ringing and incense&mdash;is in everything,
except doctrine, almost a counterpart of the
Romish system. How little could the Buddha have foreseen
such a development of his brotherhood of monks,
whose chief duties were meditation and itineration!</p>
<p>And what is to be said of the present condition of
the Buddhist monkhood? Do we see anywhere evidences
of that enlightenment of mind which Buddhism
claims as its chief characteristic?</p>
<p>When I was travelling in Ceylon, I met a few learned
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
monks, but the majority seemed to me idle, ignorant,
and indifferent.</p>
<p>In Burma the monks are called Pung&#299;s (Phongies),
and are a little more active. Every youth in Burma
is supposed for a time to inhabit a monastery.</p>
<p>In Tibet the monks are called L&#257;mas (a lower title
being Gelong) and constitute a large proportion of the
population. They are slaves to gross superstitions.
Some are mere devil-charmers, a belief in the power of
evil spirits being the chief religion of the people.</p>
<p>In China the monks are called Ho-shang (or Ho-sang).
They constitute the only section of the population who
have a right to be called Buddhists, though, after all,
they are mere pseudo-Buddhists. Professor Legge informs
me that he has known a few learned men among
them, and learned works have been written by them.
But the general testimony of Europeans in China is
that the mass of the monks there are simply drones, or
aimless dreamers, who go through their repetitions by
rote. Almost all are conspicuous for apathy, inertness,
and a vacant idiotic expression of countenance.</p>
<p>Clearly we have in their condition an example of the
fact that even moral restraint, if carried to the extreme
of extinguishing all the natural affections and desires,
must inevitably be followed by a Nemesis. Surely we
have in these monkish fraternities an illustration of the
truth that any transgression of the laws of nature,
common-sense, and reason&mdash;any suppression of the
primary instincts of humanity, must in the end incur
the penalty attached to every violation of the eternal
ordinances of God.</p>

<h2 id="c10">LECTURE V.
<br /><i>The Philosophical Doctrines of Buddhism.</i></h2>
<p>One of the most noteworthy points in the early
history of Buddhistic thought is that while Gautama
Buddha denied the existence of Brahm&#257; as a personal
Creator, and repudiated the Veda and all Vedic sacrifices
and ceremonial observances, he at the same time made
the philosophical teaching of the Br&#257;hmans the point of
departure for his own peculiar philosophical teaching.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy point is that while Buddhism
was undoubtedly a modification of philosophical Br&#257;hmanism,
the latter was also modified by an interchange
with Buddhistic ideas.</p>
<p>It may certainly be questioned whether Gautama
himself, in the early stages of his career, ever caused
much offence to the most orthodox Br&#257;hmans by the
free expression of his opinions. He did not spare either
his criticism or sarcasm, but it is well known that the
Br&#257;hmans were not only tolerant of criticism; they
were equally critical themselves, and delighted in controversial
discussions, as they do to this day.</p>
<p>In the Tevijja-Sutta an account is given of a discussion
in which, though Gautama expressed himself
strongly, he does not seem to have excited any wrath
in his opponent&mdash;a Br&#257;hman named V&#257;settha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The argument attributed to the Buddha is so remarkable
that a portion of it may be given here:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you say, V&#257;settha, that not one of the Br&#257;hmans,
or of their teachers, or of their pupils, even
up to the seventh generation, has ever seen Brahman
(the God of the Br&#257;hmans) face to face. And that
even the &#7770;ishis of old, the utterers of the ancient
verses, which the Br&#257;hmans of to-day so carefully
intone and recite precisely as they have been handed
down&mdash;even they did not pretend to know or to have
seen where or whence or whither Brahman is. So
that the Br&#257;hmans versed in the three Vedas have
forsooth said thus: &ldquo;To a state of union with that
which we know not and have not seen, we can show
the way and can say: &lsquo;This is the straight path, this
is the direct way which leads him who acts according
to it, into a state of union with Brahman<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now what think you, V&#257;settha? Does it not follow,
this being so, that the talk of the Br&#257;hmans, versed
though they be in the three Vedas, is foolish talk?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Verily, V&#257;settha, that Br&#257;hmans versed in the
three Vedas should be able to show the way to a state
of union with that which they do not know, neither
have seen&mdash;such a condition of things has no existence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As when a string of blind men are clinging one to
the other, neither can the foremost see, nor can the
middle one see, nor can the hindmost see, just so is the
talk of the Br&#257;hmans versed in the three Vedas<a class="fnref" href="#fn_44">[44]</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These no doubt were trenchant words, but it might
easily be shown that the Br&#257;hmans themselves did not
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
scruple to use almost as strong language against their
own revelation. For instance, the &#262;h&#257;ndogya Upanishad
(<a href="#Page_473">p. 473</a>) speaks of the Veda as &lsquo;mere name&rsquo; (n&#257;ma
eva). The B&#7771;ihad&#257;ra&#7751;yaka Upanishad declares that
when a man is in a condition of knowledge, &lsquo;the gods
are no gods to him, and the Veda no Veda;&rsquo; and the
Mu&#7751;&#7693;aka describes the sacrificial Veda as inferior to
Brahma-vidy&#257;.</p>
<p>And in truth every Hind&#363; was allowed to choose one
of three ways of securing his own salvation.</p>
<p>The first was &lsquo;the way of works&rsquo; (Karma-m&#257;rga),
that is to say, of sacrifices (Yaj&ntilde;a), of ceremonial rites, of
lustral washings, penances and pilgrimages, as enjoined
in the Mantra and Br&#257;hma&#7751;a portion of the Veda, in
Manu, the Law-books and parts of the Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</p>
<p>The second was &lsquo;the way of faith&rsquo; (bhakti), meaning
by that term devotion to one or other of certain commonly
worshipped personal deities,&mdash;a way leading in
later times to the worship of &#7776;iva and Vish&#7751;u (unfolded
in the Pur&#257;&#7751;as), and involving merely heart-devotion,
without sacrificial or ceremonial acts.</p>
<p>The third was &lsquo;the way of knowledge&rsquo; (J&ntilde;&#257;na), as set
forth in the Upanishads.</p>
<p>The medi&aelig;val Br&#257;hman Kum&#257;rila&mdash;a really historical
teacher&mdash;advocated the first way; another teacher of
less note, &#7776;&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ilya, advocated the second; another celebrated
historical teacher, &#7776;a&#7749;kara, advocated the third.</p>
<p>Even in Gautama&rsquo;s time any one of these ways or all
three together might be chosen, so long as the authority
of the Br&#257;hmans was not impugned.</p>
<p>This, at least, is the general teaching of the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;&mdash;an
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
eclectic work which is the most popular exponent
of the Hind&#363; creed<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a>.</p>
<p>Yet even the Author of the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; had a
preference for the way of knowledge. In one passage
(II. 42) he describes the Veda as &lsquo;mere flowery doctrine&rsquo;
(pushpit&#257; v&#257;&#263;), and is careful to point out that
works must be performed as acts of devotion leading to
absorption into the Supreme (Brahma-nirv&#257;&#7751;am).</p>
<p>Indeed there can be no doubt that it was generally
held by the Br&#257;hmans of Buddha&rsquo;s time that the way
of knowledge was the highest way. But this way was
not open to all. It was reserved for the privileged
few&mdash;for the more intellectual and philosophically-minded
Br&#257;hmans. The generality of men had to
content themselves with the first and second ways.</p>
<p>What the Buddha then did was this:&mdash;First he
stretched out the right hand of brotherhood to all
mankind by inviting all without exception to join his
fraternity of celibate monks, which he wished to be
co-extensive with the world itself. Then he abolished
the first and second ways of salvation (<a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>), that is,
Yaj&ntilde;a, &lsquo;sacrifices,&rsquo; and Bhakti, &lsquo;devotion to personal
gods,&rsquo; and substituted for these meditation and moral
conduct as the only road to true knowledge and emancipation.
And then, lastly, he threw open this highest way
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
of true knowledge to all who wished to enter it, of
whatever rank or caste or mental calibre they might
be, not excepting the most degraded.</p>
<p>Without doubt the distinguishing feature in the
Buddha&rsquo;s gospel was that no living being, not even the
lowest, was to be shut out from true enlightenment.</p>
<p>And here it will be necessary to inquire more closely
into the nature of that knowledge which the Buddha
thus made accessible to every creature in the universe.</p>
<p>Was it some deep mystery? Some occult doctrine
of physical or metaphysical science? Some startling
revelation of a law of nature never before imparted to
the world? Was the Buddha&rsquo;s open way very different
from the old, well-fenced-off Br&#257;hmanical way?</p>
<p>Of one point we may be certain. He was too
sensible to cast aside all ancient traditions. Nor was
he a mere enthusiast claiming to be the sole possessor
of a new secret for regenerating society.</p>
<p>Unhappily, however, we are here met by a difficulty.
The Buddha never, like Muhammad, wrote a book, or,
so far as we know, a line. He was the Socrates of
India, and we are obliged to trust to the record of his
sayings (see <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>). Still we have no reason to doubt
the genuineness of what was for some time handed
down orally in regard to the doctrines he taught, and
we are struck with the fact that Gautama called
his own knowledge <i>Bodhi</i> (from <i>budh</i>, &lsquo;to understand&rsquo;),
and not <i>Veda</i> (from <i>vid</i>, &lsquo;to know&rsquo;). Probably by
doing so he wished to imply that his own knowledge
was attainable by all through their own intuitions, inner
consciousness, and self-enlightening intellect, and was
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
to be distinguished from <i>Veda</i> or knowledge obtainable
through the Br&#257;hmans alone, and by them through
supernatural revelation only. Hence, too, he gave to
every being destined to become a Buddha the title
Bodhi-sattva (Bodhi-satta), &lsquo;one having knowledge
derived from <i>self-enlightening intellect</i> for his essence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it should be noted, that even in the choice of
a name derived from the Sanskrit root <i>budh</i>, the Buddha
only adopted the phraseology of the S&#257;&#7749;khya philosophy
and of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as. The S&#257;&#7749;khya system
made Buddhi, &lsquo;intellect,&rsquo; its great principle (Mahat), and
the &#7776;atapatha-br&#257;hma&#7751;a called a man who had attained
to perfect knowledge of Self prati-buddha<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a>. It may
be pointed out, too, that Manu (IV. 204) uses the same
root when he calls his wise man Budha.</p>
<p>Moreover, the doctrines which grew out of his own
special knowledge Gautama still called <i>Dharma</i> (Dhamma),
&lsquo;law,&rsquo; using the very same term employed by the
Br&#257;hmans&mdash;a term expressive of law in its most comprehensive
sense, as comprising under it the physical
laws of the Universe, as well as moral and social duties.</p>
<p>In what, then, did the Buddha&rsquo;s Dharma differ from
that of the Br&#257;hmans? One great distinction certainly
was that it contained no esoteric (rahasya) and metaphysical
doctrines in regard to matter and spirit,
reserved for the privileged few; yet some of its root-ideas
were after all mere modifications of the S&#257;&#7749;khya,
Yoga, and Ved&#257;nta systems of philosophy. His way of
knowledge, though it developed into many paths, had
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
the same point of departure. It was a knowledge of
the truth, that all life was merely one link in a series
of successive existences, and inseparably bound up with
misery. Moreover as there were two causes of that
misery&mdash;lust and ignorance&mdash;so there were two cures.</p>
<p>The first cure was <i>the suppression of lust and desire</i>,
especially of all desire for continuity of existence.</p>
<p>The second cure was <i>the removal of ignorance</i>.
Indeed Ignorance was, according to Gautama, the first
factor in the misery of life, and stands first in his chain
of causation (<a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>). Not, however, the Ved&#257;ntist&rsquo;s
ignorance&mdash;not ignorance of the fact that man and the
universe are identical with God, but ignorance of the
four truths of Buddhism (<a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>):&mdash;ignorance that all life
is misery, and that the misery of life is caused by indulging
lusts, and will cease by suppressing them.</p>
<p>It would be easy to show how all Indian philosophy
was a mere scheme for getting rid of the bugbear of
metempsychosis, and how common was the doctrine
that everything is for the worst in the worst of all
possible worlds. This was taught by the Br&#257;hmans five
centuries <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and continued to be a thoroughly Hind&#363;
idea long after the disappearance of Buddhism. Witness
the following from the Maitr&#257;ya&#7751;i Upanishad:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In this weak body, ever liable</p>
<p class="t0">To wrath, ambition, avarice, illusion,</p>
<p class="t0">To fear, grief, envy, hatred, separation</p>
<p class="t0">From those we hold most dear, association</p>
<p class="t0">With those we hate; continually exposed</p>
<p class="t0">To hunger, thirst, disease, decrepitude,</p>
<p class="t0">Emaciation, growth, decline and death,</p>
<p class="t0">What relish can there be for true enjoyment?</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Also the following, from Manu (VI. 77):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This body, like a house composed of the (five) elements, with bones
for its rafters, tendons for its connecting links, flesh and blood for its
mortar, skin for its covering; this house filled with impurities, infested
by sorrow and old age, the seat of disease, full of pain and
passion, and not lasting&mdash;a man ought certainly to abandon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also Bhart&#7771;i-hari (Vair&#257;gya-&#7777;ataka III. 32. 50):&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Enjoyments are alloyed by fear of sickness,</p>
<p class="t0">High rank may have a fall, abundant wealth</p>
<p class="t0">Is subject to exactions, dignity</p>
<p class="t0">Encounters risk of insult, strength is ever</p>
<p class="t0">In danger of enfeeblement by foes,</p>
<p class="t0">A handsome form is jeoparded by women,</p>
<p class="t0">Scripture is open to assaults of critics,</p>
<p class="t0">Merit incurs the spite of wicked men,</p>
<p class="t0">The body lives in constant dread of death&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">One course alone is proof against alarm,</p>
<p class="t0">Renounce the world, and safety may be won.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">One hundred years<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> is the appointed span</p>
<p class="t0">Of human life, one half of this goes by</p>
<p class="t0">In sleep and night; one half the other half</p>
<p class="t0">In childhood and old age; the rest is passed</p>
<p class="t0">In sickness, separation, pain, and service&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">How can a human being find delight</p>
<p class="t0">In such a life, vain as a watery bubble?</p>
</div>
<p>No doubt this kind of pessimism has always found
advocates in all ages, and among all nations in Europe
as well as in Asia. It was a favourite idea with the
Stoics, and it has found favour with Schopenhauer,
Von Hartmann, and other modern philosophers; and
Shakespeare makes Hamlet give expression to it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Happily the general tone of European philosophical
thought is in another key, and the admirers of Aristotle
still constitute a majority in Europe. The great
Stagirite described God as &lsquo;Energy,&rsquo; and in dealing
with Solon&rsquo;s dictum that &lsquo;no man can be called happy
while he lives,&rsquo; gave expression to a different belief.
A good man&rsquo;s virtuous energies, he asserted, are in
this present life a genuine source of happiness to him;
misfortunes cannot shake his well-balanced character;
he surmounts the worst sufferings by generous magnanimity<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a>.</p>
<p>Even in the East a greater than Aristotle and no less
an Authority than the true &lsquo;Light of the world&rsquo;&mdash;bade
men rejoice and leap for joy under the most trying circumstances
of life, and prize His gift of Eternal Life as
their highest good.</p>
<p>In India, on the contrary, the Upanishads and systems
of philosophy which followed on them, all harped on the
same string. They all dwelt on the same minor key-note.
Their real object was not to investigate truth,
but to devise a scheme for removing the misery believed
to result from repeated bodily existence and from all
action, good or bad, in the present, previous, and future
births.</p>
<p>The S&#257;&#7749;khya (I. 1) defines the chief aim of man to
be deliverance from the pain incident to bodily life and
energy; or according to the Ny&#257;ya (I. 2), from the pain
resulting from birth, actions, and false knowledge;
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
while the Ved&#257;nta considers that ignorance alone fetters
the soul of man to a body, and the Yoga defines the
divine Purusha (= the perfect man of Buddhism) as a
being unaffected by pain (kle&#7777;a), acts, consequences of
acts, and impressions derived from acts done in previous
births (&#257;&#7777;aya = sa&#7753;&#7777;k&#257;ra).</p>
<p>Gautama&rsquo;s sympathy with these ideas is shown by
the twelve-linked chain of causation, put forth by him
as an accompaniment to his four fundamental truths
(<a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>), and thus expressed (Mah&#257;-vagga I. 1. 2):&mdash;</p>
<p>From Ignorance comes the combination of formations
or tendencies (instincts derived from former births<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a>);
from such formations comes consciousness (vij&ntilde;&#257;na);
from consciousness, individual being (n&#257;ma-r&#363;pa, name
and form); from individual being, the six organs of
sense (including mind); from the six organs, contact
(with objects of sense); from contact, sensation (vedan&#257;);
from sensation, desire (lust, thirst, ta&#7753;h&#257; = t&#7771;ish&#7751;&#257;);
from desire, clinging to life (up&#257;d&#257;na); from clinging
to life, continuity of becoming (bhava); from continuity
of becoming, birth; from birth, decay and death; from
decay and death, suffering.</p>
<p>It is difficult to discover a strictly logical sequence
in this curious twelve-linked chain. The first link is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
cause, the ten following are both causes and effects, while
the last is an effect only. The second (sa&#7747;kh&#257;r&#257;) is presented
to us afterwards as one of the Skandhas (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>),
and we have the whole inverted in a kind of circular
chain in the form of question and answer, thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>What is the cause of misery and suffering? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;Old
age and death. What is the cause of old age
and death? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;Birth. Of birth? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;Continuity
of becoming. Of continuity of becoming?
<i>Answer</i>&mdash;Clinging to life. Of clinging to life? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;Desire.
Of desire? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;Sensation or perception.
Of sensation? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;Contact with the objects of
sense. Of contact with objects? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;The organs
of sense. Of the organs? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;Name and form,
or individual being. Of individual being? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;Consciousness
(vi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a = vij&ntilde;&#257;na). Of consciousness?
<i>Answer</i>&mdash;Combination of formations or tendencies (or
those material and mental predispositions derived from
previous births which tend to form character, compare
<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>). Of such formations? <i>Answer</i>&mdash;Ignorance.</p>
<p>In making Ignorance (Avidy&#257;) the first cause of the
misery of life, Gautama agreed with the Ved&#257;nta
(though he explained Ignorance differently, see <a href="#Page_99">p. 99</a>),
while in the remaining chain of causes (Nid&#257;na) we
detect his sympathy with the S&#257;&#7749;khya theory of a
chain of producers and products.</p>
<p>His own scheme of causation (often called Pa&#7789;i&#263;&#263;a-samupp&#257;do)
occupies an important place in Buddhistic
philosophy, as supplementary to, and complementary of,
the four truths (<a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>). It was thought out before them
(see <a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>) and is equally revered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>It is on this account that the following celebrated
formula is constantly repeated like a short creed, and is
found carved on numerous Buddhist monuments:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Conditions (or laws) of existence which proceed from
a cause, the cause of these hath the Buddha explained,
as also the cessation (or destruction) of these. Of such
truths is the Great &#7776;rama&#7751;a the teacher<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was the formula repeated by Assaji to S&#257;riputta
and Moggall&#257;na (<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>), when they wished to join the
Buddha and asked for a summary of the spirit (artha),
not the letter (vya&ntilde;jana), of his doctrine (Mah&#257;-v&deg; I. 23.
5). Certainly the sorites-like form of statement in the
scheme of causation had charms for Oriental thinkers.</p>
<p>Moreover the Buddha&rsquo;s method of clothing old truths
in a new dress, or&mdash;to adopt another metaphor&mdash;his
plan of putting new wine into old bottles, had in it
something very attractive to all Indian minds.</p>
<p>Of what kind, then, was the new dress in which
Gautama clothed the great central doctrine of Indian
philosophy&mdash;the doctrine of metempsychosis, involving
the perpetuation of the misery of life?</p>
<p>The Buddha, like all Indians, was by nature a metaphysician.
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
He had great sympathy with the philosophy
of the Upanishads. How was it that he disbelieved
in the existence of Spirit as distinct from bodily organism?
A little consideration will perhaps make clear
how he was brought to his own peculiar agnostic view.</p>
<p>Probably before his so-called enlightenment and
attainment of true knowledge, he was as firm a believer
in the real existence of one Universal Spirit as
the most orthodox Br&#257;hman. He had become imbued
with Br&#257;hmanical philosophy while sitting at the feet of
his two teachers &#256;&#7735;&#257;ra and Uddaka (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>). At that
time there were no definite or formulated philosophical
systems, separated from each other by sharp lines.
But the S&#257;&#7749;khya, Yoga, and Ved&#257;nta systems were assuming
shape, and the doctrines they embodied had
been foreshadowed in the Upanishads, and were orally
current.</p>
<p>In short, it had been repeatedly stated in the Upanishads,
that nothing really existed but the one universally
present impersonal Spirit, and that the whole visible
world was really to be identified with that Spirit.</p>
<p>Then it followed as an article of faith that man&rsquo;s
spirit, deluded into a temporary false idea of separate
independent personal existence by the illusion of ignorance,
was also identical with that One Spirit, and
ultimately to be re-absorbed into it.</p>
<p>Further, it followed that man&rsquo;s spirit, while so
deluded and so separated for a time from the One
Spirit, was compelled to migrate through innumerable
bodily forms, and that such migration entailed misery,
from which there was no escape except by a process of
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
disillusionment, that is, by dissipating the illusion of
separate individuality, through the acquisition of perfect
knowledge leading to re-union with the One Spirit, as
the river blends with the ocean. And such knowledge
was best gained by suppression of the passions, abandonment
of all worldly connexions, and abstinence from
all action. Finally, it was held, with apparent inconsistency,
that the storing up of merit by good works
assisted in effecting this object by raising a man, not
yet fit for union with the supreme Spirit, to forms of
existence in which such union might be accomplished.</p>
<p>Now it is obvious that to believe in the ultimate
merging of man&rsquo;s personal spirit in One impersonal
Spirit, is virtually to deny the ultimate existence of
any human spirit at all. Nay more&mdash;it is virtually to
deny the existence of a supreme universal Spirit also.</p>
<p>For how can a merely abstract universal Spirit, which
is unconscious of personality, be regarded as possessing
any real existence worth being called true life?</p>
<p>To assert that such a Spirit is pure abstract Entity
or (according to Ved&#257;nta phraseology) pure Existence
(without anything to exist for), pure Thought or even
pure Consciousness (without anything to think about,
or be conscious about), pure Joy (without anything
to rejoice about), is practically to reduce it to pure
non-entity.</p>
<p>All that Gautama did, therefore, was to purge
Br&#257;hmanism of a dogma which appeared to him to be
a mere sham (Brahma-j&#257;la I. 26).</p>
<p>He simply eliminated as incapable of proof the
doctrine of a purely abstract, incorporeal spirit or self,
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
whether human or divine. The assertion that any soul
or self or Ego really existed (Atta-v&#257;do) was an error.
It formed one of the constituents of Up&#257;d&#257;na (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>),
and was the first of the ten fetters (Sakk&#257;ya-di&#7789;&#7789;hi,
<a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>).</p>
<p>And with the rejection of this dogma, as incapable
of demonstration, he found himself compelled to reject
also, as beyond the range of man&rsquo;s cognizance, the
doctrine of any Supreme Being higher than the perfectly
enlightened man. Like Kapila in the S&#257;&#7749;khya
aphorisms (I. 92, V. 10) he felt bound to admit: &lsquo;It
is not proved that there is a God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This, indeed, is the chief foundation on which rests
the assertion that Buddhism is a mere system of
atheistic negations. And there can be no doubt that
from one point of view its statements are steeped in
negations, or rather perhaps in evasions. Its morality
has been described as more negative than positive;
but this is scarcely correct, and it would be fairer
to say that it delights in telling men to abstain
from doing evil, rather than in urging them to active
exertions for the good of others. It has many positive
precepts.</p>
<p>But if there was no probability of a soul existing
separately from a body after death, how could there be
any soul-transmigration? How could there be any
agreement between the teaching of the Buddha and
that of the Br&#257;hmans, in regard to this important
central dogma? The real fact was that the divergence
of the Buddhist doctrine from the Br&#257;hmanical,
as stated in the Upanishads, was not greater than
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
was to be expected from the difference of belief between
the two systems in regard to the existence of soul.</p>
<p>Plato, we know, held that souls &lsquo;found their prisons
in the same natures&rsquo; at death, so that an effeminate
man might be re-born as a woman, a tyrannical man
as a wolf, and so on. In Manu&rsquo;s Law-book is set forth
a triple order of soul-transmigration through lower,
middle, and higher planes of existence, resulting from
good, middling, and bad acts, words, and thoughts.
Thus&mdash;to instance only the lower&mdash;the soul of a man
who spoke ill of his teacher was destined to pass into
an ass or a dog (II. 201), the soul of a thief might
occupy a mouse (XII. 62), the soul of one who neglected
his caste-duties might pass into a demon (XII. 71, 72);
and greater crimes might lead to the soul&rsquo;s being condemned
to occupy plants, stones, and minerals. Then
there was also an intermediate condition of the soul.
According to one idea it went to the moon; according
to another it became a hungry ghost which required
food to be offered to it at the &#7776;r&#257;ddha ceremonies.</p>
<p>This theory of transmigration, according to the Hind&#363;s,
explained the origin of evil. Evil must proceed from
antecedent evil, and the resulting penalty must be
borne by the evil-doer in succeeding existences. This
was the terrible incubus which it was the great
object of Indian philosophers to remove. It was
equally Gautama&rsquo;s object, but how could he accept
soul-transmigration, denying as he did the existence
of any spirit, as distinct from material organization?
He therefore put forth a view of his own, thus:&mdash;Every
being is composed of five constituent elements
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
called Skandhas (P&#257;li Khandha), which have their
source in Up&#257;d&#257;na (<a href="#Page_103">p. 103</a>) and are continually combining,
dissolving, and recombining, viz. 1. Form (<i>r&#363;pa</i>),
i. e. the organized body. 2. Sensation (<i>vedan&#257;</i>) of pain
or pleasure, or of neither, arising from contact of eye,
ear, nose, tongue, skin, and mind with external objects.
3. Perception (<i>sa&ntilde;&ntilde;a</i> = <i>sa&ntilde;j&ntilde;&#257;</i>) of ideas through the
same sixfold contact. 4. Aggregate of formations
(<i>sa&#7747;kh&#257;ra</i> = <i>sa&#7753;sk&#257;ra</i>, i.e. combination of properties or
faculties or mental tendencies, fifty-two in number,
forming individual character and derived from previous
existences; compare the similar sa&#7747;kh&#257;r&#257; pl. at <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>).
5. Consciousness (<i>vi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a</i> = <i>vij&ntilde;&#257;na</i>) or thought<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a>. This
fifth is the most important. It is the only soul recognized
by Buddhists. Theoretically it perishes with
the other Skandhas, but practically is continued, since
its exact counterpart is reproduced in a new body.</p>
<p>For although, when a man dies, all the five constituents
of existence are dissolved, yet by the force resulting
from his actions (<i>karma</i>), combined with <i>Up&#257;d&#257;na</i>,
&lsquo;clinging to existence&rsquo; (one form of the fetters at
<a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>), a new set of five, of which consciousness is
still the dominant faculty, starts into being. The
process of the new creation is so instantaneous that
it is equivalent to the continuance of the same personality,
pervaded by the same consciousness; though
each personality is only really connected with the
previous by the force of acts done and character
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
formed in each&mdash;such force operating through Up&#257;d&#257;na.
In short, to speak of transmigration of souls in Buddhism
gives a wrong idea. Metempsychosis with Buddhists
resolves itself into continuous metamorphosis or Palingenesis.
For no true Buddhist believes in the passing
of a soul from one body to another, but rather in the
passing on of what may be called act-force, or of the
merit and demerit resulting from a man&rsquo;s acts, so as
to cause a continuous succession of transformations&mdash;a
succession which may be compared to the rolling on of
a wheel through different scenes and over every variety
of ground; or to the burning on, through day and
night, of a flame which is not the same flame at the
beginning of the day and end of the night, and yet
is not different. It is this act-force (Karma), combined
with Up&#257;d&#257;na, &lsquo;clinging to existence&rsquo; (=abhi-nive&#7777;a in
the Yoga II. 9), which is the connecting link between
each man&rsquo;s past, present, and future bodies.</p>
<p>In its subtle and irresistible operation it may be
compared to stored-up chemical or electric energy. It
is a force which continually creates and re-creates
the whole man, and perpetuates his personal identity
through separate forms, whether it compels him to
ascend or descend in the scale of being.</p>
<p>Yet to say that personality is transmitted, when
there is no consciousness of any continuity of identity,
amounts, after all, to denial of continuous existence.</p>
<p>Be it observed, too, that the scale of existence is
limited in Buddhism to six classes of beings&mdash;gods,
men, demons, animals, ghosts, and dwellers in hell
(<a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>). Transmigration is not extended, as in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
Br&#257;hmanical system, to plants, stocks, and stones;
though a man could be born as a tree-god (<a href="#Page_112">p. 112</a>).</p>
<p>Gautama Buddha himself was merely the last link in a
long chain of corporeal forms, and he had been preceded
by twenty-four Buddhas, who were to previous ages of
the world what he was to the present. Every one of
these Buddhas was gifted with the faculty of recollecting
his previous personalities, and Gautama often gave
an account of his own former existences. The stories of
about five hundred and fifty of his births (J&#257;takas) are
even now daily repeated to eager listeners in every
Buddhist country, and are believed to convey important
lessons, though full of puerilities.</p>
<p>The interchange of ideas between Br&#257;hmanism and
Buddhism is well exemplified not only by the twenty-five
Buddhas, who correspond to the fourteen Manus,
or representative men, in each world-period (Antara),
but also by the birth-stories, many of which are mere
modifications of old fables long current in India, while
others have been imported from Buddhism into Sansk&#7771;it
literature. They constantly remind one of similar
stories in the Pa&ntilde;&#263;a-tantra, Hitopade&#7777;a, R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a, and
Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata. The noteworthy point about the repeated
births of Gautama Buddha is, that there appears
to have been no Darwinian rise from lower
to higher forms; but a mere jumble of metamorphoses.
Thus we find him born four times as Mah&#257;-brahm&#257;,
twenty times as Indra, once as a hare, eighty-three
times as an ascetic, fifty-eight as a king, twenty-four
as a Br&#257;hman, once as a gamester, eighteen times as
a monkey, six as an elephant, eleven as a deer,
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
once as a dog, four times as a serpent, six as a
snipe, once as a frog, twice as a fish, forty-three times
as a tree-god, twice as a pig, ten times as a lion, four
as a cock, twice as a thief, once as a devil-dancer,
and so on. He was never born as a woman, nor as
an insect, nor as a Preta, nor an inhabitant of hell
(<a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>), and in all his births he was a Bodhi-sattva
(pp. <a href="#Page_98">98</a>, <a href="#Page_135">135</a>). And in all he suffered and sacrificed
himself for the good of the world.</p>
<p>Here is the substance of an account of Gautama&rsquo;s
birth as a hare, given by himself (&#262;ariy&#257;-Pi&#7789;aka I.
10, translated by Dr. Oldenberg):&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In one of my lives I was a hare living in a forest.
I ate grass and did no one any harm. An ape, a jackal,
and an otter dwelt with me. I used to teach them their
duties and tell them to abstain from evil and give alms
on the four fast-days in every month. They did as I
told them, and gave beans, corn, and rice. Then I said
to myself:&mdash;Suppose a worthy object of charity passes
by, what can I give him? I live on grass only; I cannot
offer a starving man grass; I must give him myself.
Thereupon the god &#7776;akra, wishing to test my sincerity,
came in a Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s form and asked me for food.
When I saw him I said joyfully:&mdash;&ldquo;A noble gift will I
give thee, O Br&#257;hman; thou observest the precepts;
thou painest no creature; thou wilt not kill me for
food. But go, collect wood, place it in a heap, and
kindle a fire. Then I will roast myself, and thou
may&rsquo;st eat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He said:&mdash;&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and went and gathered wood
and kindled a fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&lsquo;When the wood began to send forth flame, I leaped
into the midst of the blazing fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As water quenches heat, so the flames quelled all the
sufferings of life. Cuticle and skin, flesh and sinews,
bones, ligaments, and heart&mdash;my whole body with all
its limbs&mdash;I gave to the Br&#257;hman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the best and most often recited J&#257;taka is
the last birth but one, in which he was born as prince
Vessantara (Vai&#7777;y&#257;ntara). This is called the Mah&#257;-j&#257;taka,
&lsquo;great birth.&rsquo; It may be summarized thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vessantara (afterwards Buddha) was so liberal that he
gave to every one who asked. Among his possessions
was a white elephant, which had the power of bringing
down rain whenever it was needed. At last he gave
away this also to a neighbouring country suffering from
drought. This so incensed his own people that they
persuaded the king his father to banish him with his
wife and two children to the forest. They set out in a
chariot drawn by horses. First he gave away the
horses and next the chariot to Br&#257;hmans who begged
for them. Then when another Br&#257;hman asked for
the children, Vessantara gave them up too, saying:
&ldquo;May I for this act become a Buddha!&rdquo; In short his
sufferings and theirs in banishment, and his generosity
to every one, led to his recall with great rejoicings.
When he died he was born again in the Tushita heaven,
whence he descended as a white elephant into the womb
of M&#257;y&#257;, and was born as Gautama&rsquo; (<a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>).</p>
<p>Another wise man of the East, who lived long before
Gautama, spoke of &lsquo;the path of the just shining more
and more unto the perfect day.&rsquo; Of this kind of progressive
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
advance towards higher planes of perfection,
the Indian sage knew nothing. Nor to the Buddha, of
course, would the Christian idea of &lsquo;original sin,&rsquo; or
of imputed Perfection have conveyed any meaning
whatever. With Gautama, righteousness and unrighteousness,
holiness and sin, were the product of a man&rsquo;s
own acts. They were produced by no one but himself,
and they were merely troublesome forces (see <a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>)
causing, in the one case, a man&rsquo;s re-birth either in one
of the heavens or in higher earthly corporeal forms,
and, in the other, his re-birth in one of the hells or in
lower corporeal forms. &lsquo;Not in the heavens,&rsquo; says the
Dhamma-pada (127), &lsquo;not in the midst of the sea, not
if thou hidest thyself in the clefts of the mountains,
wilt thou find a place where thou canst escape the
force resulting from thy evil actions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here also is the substance of a passage in the Deva-d&#363;ta-sutta
(translated by Dr. Oldenberg):&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not relatives and friends welcome a man who
has been long travelling, when he returns safely to his
home? Even so, a righteous man, when he passes
from this world to another, is welcomed by his good
works, as by friends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Through the six states of transmigration does the
power of our actions lead us. A life in the heavens
awaits the good. The wardens of hell drag the wicked
before the king of hell, Yama, who says to them:&mdash;&ldquo;Did
you not, when on earth, see the five divine
messengers, sent to warn you&mdash;the child, the old man,
the sick, the criminal suffering punishment, and the
dead corpse?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&lsquo;And the wicked man answers:&mdash;&ldquo;I did see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And didst thou not think within thyself:&mdash;&ldquo;I also
am subject to birth, old age, death. Let me be careful
to do good works?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the wicked man answers:&mdash;&ldquo;I did not, sire;
I neglected in my folly to think of these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then king Yama pronounces his doom:&mdash;&ldquo;These thy
evil deeds are not the work of thy mother, father,
relations, friends, advisers. Thou alone hast done
them all; thou alone must gather the fruit.&rdquo; And the
warders of hell drag him to the place of torment, rivet
him to red-hot iron, plunge him in glowing seas of
blood, torture him on heaps of burning coal; and he
dies not, till the last residue of his guilt has been
expiated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And this Buddhist theory of every man&rsquo;s destiny
being dependent on his own acts is quite in keeping
with Br&#257;hmanical ideas. &lsquo;In that (new body) he is
united with the knowledge gained in the former body,
and then again goes on working for perfection; for
even against his will he is forced on (from one body to
another) by his former works&rsquo; (Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; VI. 43,
44). And again:&mdash;&lsquo;The act committed in a former
birth (p&#363;rva-janma-k&#7771;ita&#7747; karma), that is called one&rsquo;s
destiny;&rsquo; and again, &lsquo;As from a lump of clay a workman
makes what he pleases, even so a man obtains
whatever destiny he has wrought out for himself&rsquo;
(Hitopade&#7777;a, Introduction). In Br&#257;hmanism the influence
of Karma or &lsquo;act&rsquo; in determining every being&rsquo;s
form at the time of his own re-birth is universal.</p>
<p>Thus also the Ny&#257;ya of Gautama (III. 132) affirms
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
that the new body (after death) is produced through
the irresistible force of actions done in the previous
body (p&#363;rva-k&#7771;ita-phal&#257;nubandh&#257;t tad-utpatti&#7717;). The
cosmogony of the same philosophy (Vai&#7777;eshika branch),
taught that the concurrence of eternal atoms to form
the world was the result of Ad&#7771;ish&#7789;a or the &lsquo;unseen
force&rsquo; derived from the acts of a previous world.</p>
<p>We are reminded, too, of our poet&rsquo;s own sentiment:
&lsquo;Our deeds still travel with us from afar, And what
we have been makes us what we are;&rsquo; and of Don
Quixote&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;Every man is the son of his own
works;&rsquo; and of Wordsworth&rsquo;s, &lsquo;The child is father of
the man;&rsquo; and of Longfellow&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Lives of great men
all remind us, we can make ourselves sublime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In short, we are the outcome of ourselves. Nor can
ceremonies avail aught, nor can devotion to personal
gods avail aught, nor can anything whatever possess
the slightest efficacy to save a man from his own acts.</p>
<p>It is said that Buddhism leaves the will unfettered;
but surely fatalism is taught when the force of one&rsquo;s
own deeds in previous births is held to be irresistible.</p>
<p>The only creator, then, recognized by true Buddhists
is Act-force. &lsquo;My action is the womb that bears me,&rsquo;
says the A&#7749;guttara Nik&#257;ya. It is this Act-force that
creates worlds. It is this Act-force, in conjunction with
Up&#257;d&#257;na (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>), that creates all beings in any of
the six classes into which they are divided&mdash;gods, men,
demons, animals, ghosts, and the dwellers in hell. We
often talk of the force of a dead man&rsquo;s acts&mdash;of his
being dead and yet speaking. It is this force which
in Buddhism resists death; for no force can ever be lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>And what does the modern Positivist philosopher
assert? He maintains that both body and mind are
resolved into their elements at death. The only immortal
part of us consists in the good deeds, words,
thoughts, and influences we leave behind us, to be made
use of by our descendants and improved on for the
elevation of humanity. And the aggregate of these,
combined with the force of will, constitute, according
to the Buddhist, a power strong enough to re-create
not only human beings but the whole material world.</p>
<p>It was thus that the force of Gautama&rsquo;s own acts
had constantly re-created him through a long chain
of successive personalities, terminating in the perfect
Buddha, who has no further births to undergo.</p>
<p>Turn we now to that division of the Buddhist system
which concerns itself with the external universe, and
seeks to explain its constitution, form, and the various
divisions of which it consists.</p>
<p>And here we must be careful to note the peculiar
views of Buddhism, notwithstanding the large admixture
of Br&#257;hmanical ideas.</p>
<p>For Buddhism has no cosmogony like the S&#257;&#7749;khya,
Ved&#257;nta, and Vai&#7777;eshika. Nor does it explain the
creation of the universe, in our sense. It only concerns
itself with cosmology, and it dissents from Br&#257;hmanical
cosmology in declining to admit the eternity of anything
whatever, except change or revolution or a succession
of revolutions. Buddhism has no Creator, no
creation, no original germ of all things, no soul of the
world, no personal, no impersonal, no supramundane,
no antemundane principle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>It might indeed have been supposed that since Gautama
denied the eternal existence of either a personal
God or of Spirit, he would at least have given eternal
existence to matter.</p>
<p>But no; the only eternal things are the Causality of
Act-force and the succession of cause and effect&mdash;the
eternity of &lsquo;Becoming,&rsquo; not of &lsquo;Being.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Universe around us, with all its visible phenomena,
must be recognized as an existing entity, for
we see before our eyes evidence of its actual existence.
But it is an entity produced out of nonentity, and
destined to lapse again into nonentity when its time is
fulfilled.</p>
<p>For out of nothingness it came, and into nothingness
must it return&mdash;to re-appear again, it is true, but as
a new Universe brought into being by the accumulated
force of its predecessor&rsquo;s acts, and not evolved out
of any eternally existing spiritual or material germ of
any kind.</p>
<p>It is thus that Universe after Universe is like a succession
of countless bubbles for ever forming, expanding,
drifting onwards, bursting and re-forming, each
bubble owing its re-formation to the force generated
by its vanished predecessor. The poet Shelley might
have been called a Buddhist when he wrote:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Worlds on worlds are rolling ever</p>
<p class="t">From creation to decay;</p>
<p class="t0">Like the bubbles on a river,</p>
<p class="t">Sparkling, bursting, borne away. (<span class="sc">Hellas.</span>)</p>
</div>
<p>Or like lotuses, for ever unfolding and then decaying,
each decay containing the germ of a new plant;
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
or like an interminable succession of wheels for ever
coming into view, for ever rolling onwards, disappearing
and reappearing; for ever passing from being
to non-being, and again from non-being to being. It
was this ceaseless rotation that led to the wheel
being adopted as the favourite symbol in Buddhism
(<a href="#Page_122">p. 122</a>).</p>
<p>Christianity recognizes in a very different way
this &lsquo;law of circularity&rsquo; in the physical world, as the
Rev. Hugh Macmillan has ably pointed out.</p>
<p>As to the question from whom? or whence? or how?
came the original force or impetus that started the first
movement, the Buddha hazarded no opinion. He held
this to be an inexplicable mystery&mdash;an insoluble riddle.
He confessed himself to be a thorough Agnostic. He
saw nothing but countless cycles of causes and effects,
and never undertook to explain the first cause which
set the first wheel in motion. It was not, then, without
a deep significance that Gautama placed Ignorance first
in his chain of Causation (<a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>. Note, however, the
explanation given at <a href="#Page_99">p. 99</a>).</p>
<p>After all, these Buddhistic speculations amount to
little else than Br&#257;hmanism stripped of some of its
transcendental mysticism. We know, for example, that
the true Ved&#257;nta philosophy makes the Universe proceed
out of an eternal Illusion, or Ignorance associated
with the impersonal Spirit Brahman, into which it is
again absorbed.</p>
<p>Can it be affirmed, then, a Buddhist might say, that
either this pure impersonal Spirit (or Ignorance) is
virtually very different from pure nothingness?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>What says the author of &#7770;ig-veda X. 120?&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In the beginning there was neither naught nor aught,</p>
<p class="t0">Then there was neither sky nor atmosphere above.</p>
<p class="t0">Then first came darkness hid in darkness, gloom in gloom;</p>
<p class="t0">Next all was water, all a chaos indiscreet,</p>
<p class="t0">In which the One lay void, shrouded in nothingness.</p>
</div>
<p>Then as to the vast periods called Kalpas or ages,
during which (as in Br&#257;hmanism) constant Universes
are supposed to appear, disappear, and re-appear:&mdash;</p>
<p>Let it be supposed, say Buddhist writers, that a solid
rock forming a vast cube sixteen miles high, and the
same in length and breadth, were lightly rubbed once in
a hundred years with a piece of the finest cloth, and
by this slight friction reduced in countless ages to the
size of a mango-seed; that would still give you no idea
of the immense duration of a Buddhist Kalpa.</p>
<p>And what, in conclusion, is the existing Universe?
Buddhist writers make it consist of an infinite number
of &#262;akkav&#257;las (&#262;akra-v&#257;las) or vast circular planes,
which for convenience may be called spheres. Each
sphere has thirty-one Satta-lokas (Sattva-lokas) or
dwelling-places of six classes of living beings, rising
one above the other and distributed under three world-systems,
built up in successive tiers through infinite
space, below, upon, and above Mount Meru (or Sumeru)&mdash;the
ideal central point of the whole. This gigantic
mythical mountain forms the mighty base or pivot of
the sphere.</p>
<p>First comes Hell with 136 divisions, to receive 136
varieties of offenders, all in tiers one above the other, and
lying deep under the earth in the lower regions of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
&#262;akra-v&#257;la. To be re-born in Hell (Naraka) is the
worst of all the six kinds of existence, reserved for the
worst evil-doers, and although the punishment is not
eternal, its shortest duration is for five hundred years
of Hell, each day equalling fifty years of Earth. In
Br&#257;hmanism there are twenty-one hells (Manu IV.
88-90). Buddhism originally had only eight. The most
terrific (Av&#299;&#263;i) is for revilers of Buddha and his Law.</p>
<p>Above the subdivisions of Hell come the other
sensuous worlds (K&#257;ma-lokas), thus:&mdash;(2) the world of
animals; (3) that of Pretas or ghosts; (4) that of
Asuras or demons; (5) the earth, or world of men,
with concentric circles of seven seas.</p>
<p>Having distributed all possible places of habitation
for migrating beings under the three heads of Hell,
four lower worlds, and twenty-six heavens (described at
<a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>), Buddhism holds that there are only six forms
or ways (gati) of existence through which living beings
can pass, and under which every thing that has life
must be classed, and of these the first two ways are
good, the last four bad, thus:&mdash;1. Gods; 2. Men;
3. Asuras, or demons, inhabiting spaces under the
earth; 4. Animals; 5. Pretas, or ghosts, recently inhabitants
of earth, and ever consumed with hunger and
thirst; 6. Beings undergoing torment in the hells.</p>
<p>As to the gods, bear in mind that Buddhism recognized
most of the deities of Hind&#363;ism. See <a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>.</p>
<p>Such gods existed in subtle corporeal forms, and,
though not omnipotent, were capable of working benefit
or harm. They were subject to the universal law of
dissolution, and after death were succeeded by others, so
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
that there was not one Brahm&#257; or one &#7776;akra, but many
successive deities so named, and many classes of deities
under them. They had no power of effecting any person&rsquo;s
salvation. On the contrary, they had to see to
their own, and were inferior to the perfected man.</p>
<p>Moreover, to be born in the world of the gods seems
not to have implied any vast accumulation of merit, for
we read of a certain frog that from simply listening to
the Buddha&rsquo;s voice, while reciting the Law, was born
as a god in the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a heaven (Hardy, <a href="#Page_392">p. 392</a>).</p>
<p>In short, the constant revolving of the wheel of life
in one eternal circle, according to fixed and immutable
laws, is perhaps after all the sum and substance of the
philosophy of Buddhism. And this eternal wheel or
circle has, so to speak, six spokes representing six forms
of existence.</p>
<p>When any one of the six classes of beings dies,
he must be born again in some one of these same
six classes, for there are no other possible ways (gati)
of life, and he cannot pass into plants, stones, and
inorganic matter, as in the Br&#257;hmanical system (see
<a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>). If he be born again in one of the hells he is
not thereby debarred from seeking salvation, and even
if he be born in heaven as a god, he must at some
time or other leave it and seek after a higher state
still&mdash;that of the perfect man who has gained Nirv&#257;&#7751;a
and is soon to achieve the one consummation worth
living for, the one crown worth striving for&mdash;extinction
of personal existence in Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a (see pp. <a href="#Page_138">138</a>-142).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c11">LECTURE VI.
<br /><i>The Morality of Buddhism and its chief aim&mdash;Arhatship or Nirv&#257;&#7751;a.</i></h2>
<p>The first questions suggested by the subject of this
lecture will probably be:&mdash;</p>
<p>How could a life of morality be inculcated by one
who made all life proceed from ignorance, and even
virtuous conduct in one sense a mistake, as leading to
continuity of life, and therefore of suffering? How
could the Buddha&rsquo;s first commandment be, &lsquo;Destroy
not,&rsquo; when his ideal of perfection was destruction?
How could he say, &lsquo;be active,&rsquo; when his theory of
Karma (pp. <a href="#Page_110">110</a>, <a href="#Page_114">114</a>) made action conduce to misery?</p>
<p>The inconsistency is evident, but it is no less true
that, notwithstanding the doctrine that all existence
entails misery, and that all action, good or bad, leads
to future births, Gautama taught that the life of a
man in higher bodily forms, or in one of the heavens,
was better than a life in lower forms, or in one of the
hells, and that neither a higher form of life nor the
great aim of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a could be attained without
righteous action, meditation, and true knowledge.</p>
<p>Buddhism, indeed, as we have seen, could not hold
forth as an incentive to good behaviour any belief
in a Creator rewarding and punishing his creatures
according to their works, or pardoning their sins. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
could not inculcate piety; for in true Buddhism piety
was impossible; yet like Manu (II. 6) it made morality
(&#7777;&#299;la) the basis of Law (Dharma); it stimulated good
conduct by its doctrine of repeated births, and by
pictures of its numerous heavens, and it deterred men
from unrighteous acts by its terrible places of torment.</p>
<p>Let it then be made clear from the first that
Buddhism, in inculcating morality, used no word expressive
of morality, as founded on the love and fear
of God, or of sin as an offence against God.</p>
<p>In Buddhism the words kle&#7777;a (kileso), &lsquo;pain,&rsquo; and
aku&#7777;ala, &lsquo;demerit,&rsquo; take the place of &lsquo;sin,&rsquo; and its perfect
saint is said to be &lsquo;free from pain&rsquo; (nishkle&#7777;a) and from
demerit, not from sin in our sense. By an unrighteous
act it meant an act producing suffering and demerit of
some kind (<a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>), and it bade every man act righteously
in order to escape suffering and to accumulate merit
(ku&#7777;ala), and thus work out his own perfection&mdash;that
is to say, his own self-extinction.</p>
<p>Doubtless Buddhism deserves credit for laying stress
on right belief, right words, right work, instead of
on ceremonial rites; and on the worship of Hind&#363;
gods; but it had its own idea of right. It urged
householders to abandon the world, or else to be diligent
in serving its monks for the working out of their
own salvation; and while making morality, meditation,
and enlightenment its indispensable factors in securing
perfection, it made perfection consist in freedom from
the delusion that &lsquo;I am;&rsquo; and in deliverance from an
individual existence inseparably bound up with misery.</p>
<p>Mark, too, another contradiction. It inculcated entire
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
self-dependence in working out this kind of perfection,
and yet it set before its disciples three guides; namely,
the Buddha&rsquo;s own example, the Law (Dharma), and
the example of the whole body of monks and perfected
saints (Sa&#7749;gha).</p>
<p>We now turn to its fuller moral system, keeping this
distinct from its philosophy and metaphysics, and freely
admitting that there are in Buddhist morality many
things, true, honourable, just, pure, lovely, and of good
report.</p>
<p>It is fair to point out at the outset that Buddhist
morality was not a purely external matter. It divided
men into the outwardly correct and internally sincere.
The mere outwardly correct Buddhists might include
monks as well as laymen, though a higher standard of
profession was expected of monks. The internally
sincere were the really earnest seekers after perfection
(monks and laymen), and were divided into four classes,
representing four conditions of the inner life, lower,
higher, still higher, and highest, culminating in perfect
Saintship, Arhatship, and Nirv&#257;&#7751;a (<a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>).</p>
<p>At the same time there was not much hope of saintship
except through celibacy and monkhood; for in
true Buddhism the notion of holy family-life was
almost a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Of course the Buddhist moral code soon passed
beyond the eightfold path propounded by Gautama in
his first sermon (see <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>), and Dr. Oldenberg has
shown that in the absence of a systematically arranged
code, we may still trace out amid a confusion of precepts
the three leading duties of external moral conduct
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
(&#7777;&#299;la), of internal mental concentration (sam&#257;dhi), and
of acquiring true wisdom (pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257; = praj&ntilde;&#257;). Compare
Dr. Wenzel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Friendly Epistle,&rsquo; 53.</p>
<p>The five fundamental rules of moral conduct (&#7777;&#299;la),
or rather, prohibitions, were promulgated very early:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Kill not any living thing. 2. Steal not. 3.
Commit not adultery. 4. Lie not. 5. Drink not
strong drink. These five, having reference chiefly to
one&rsquo;s neighbour, were called the fivefold law <i>for all
classes</i>, including laymen. They were taken from
Br&#257;hmanism, but in the vows of the Sanny&#257;s&#299; the
fifth was not included. It was Buddhism probably that
first interdicted strong drink. It prohibited too what
the Br&#257;hmans allowed&mdash;killing for sacrificial purposes.</p>
<p>Five others of a more trivial character for monks
(often given in a different order, <a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>) were added:&mdash;</p>
<p>6. Eat no food, except at stated times. 7. Use no
wreaths, ornaments, or perfumes. 8. Use no high or
broad bed, but only a mat on the ground. 9. Abstain
from dancing, singing, music, and worldly spectacles.
10. Own no gold, or silver of any kind, and accept
none (Mah&#257;-vagga I. 56). [This Buddhist Decalogue
may be contrasted with the Mosaic Decalogue.]</p>
<p>All ten were binding on monks only, and for the
third was then substituted &lsquo;be absolutely chaste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes not only the first five but the first eight
were held to be binding on laymen.</p>
<p>Another was added in later times:&mdash;Never think or
say that your own religion is the best. Never denounce
the religion of others (see <a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>).</p>
<p>Then, although only the first half of the eightfold
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
path (<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>) was said to be necessary for lay-brethren,
the whole was for monks, who also had to observe the
special practices already described (<a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>).</p>
<p>All gambling and games of chance were prohibited
(Tevijja-Sutta II). Compare Manu IX. 221-228.</p>
<p>Sometimes five renunciations are named:&mdash;of wife,
of children, of money, of life, of craving for existence
in future births.</p>
<p>Then sometimes three (sometimes four) corrupting
influences (&#257;sava = &#257;srava) are enumerated&mdash;of lust
(k&#257;ma), of life, of ignorance, (of delusion.)</p>
<p>Most important to be got rid of are the ten fetters
(sa&#7747;yojana, <a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>) binding a man to existence:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Belief in the existence of a personal self or Ego
(sakk&#257;ya-di&#7789;&#7789;hi); 2. Doubt (vi&#263;ikits&#257;); 3. Ceremonial
practices (s&#299;labbata = &#7777;&#299;la-vrata); 4. Lust or sensuality
(k&#257;ma); 5. Anger (pa&#7789;igha); 6. Craving for life in a
material form (r&#363;pa-r&#257;ga) either on earth or in heaven;
7. Longing for immaterial life (ar&#363;pa-r&#257;ga) in the
higher heavens; 8. Pride (m&#257;na); 9. Self-exaltation
(auddhatya); 10. Ignorance. Of these, 1, 3, and 4,
with di&#7789;&#7789;hi, &lsquo;wrong belief,&rsquo; are the four constituents
of Up&#257;d&#257;na, &lsquo;clinging to existence&rsquo; (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>).</p>
<p>The seven jewels of the law (<a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>) are&mdash;1. the five
contemplations or reflections; 2. the four right exertions
(<a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>); 3. the four paths to supernatural power
(<a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>); 4. the five moral forces (<a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>); 5. the right
use of the five organs of sense; 6. the seven limbs of
knowledge (<a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>); 7. the eightfold path (<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>).</p>
<p>The five above-named reflections are&mdash;1. on the
thirty-two impurities of the body; 2. on the duty of
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
displaying love (Maitr&#299;) towards all beings; 3. on compassion
for all who suffer; 4. on rejoicing with all who
rejoice; 5. on absolute indifference (upeksh&#257;) to joy or
sorrow. These contemplations (bh&#257;van&#257;) in Buddhism
take the place of prayer. The last is the highest. The
first is also a Sati-pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na (<a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>). They must not be
confused with the meditations (Dhy&#257;nas, <a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>).</p>
<p>Then come six (or ten) transcendent virtues called
P&#257;ramit&#257;s, &lsquo;leading to the further shore,&rsquo; for Arhats.
These, too, every Bodhi-sattva had to practise before
he could attain Buddhahood. They were:&mdash;1. Generosity
or giving (D&#257;na) to all who ask, even the sacrificing
of limbs or life for others; this is most important;
2. Virtue or moral conduct (&#7776;&#299;la); 3. Patience or tolerance
(Ksh&#257;nti); 4. Fortitude or energy (V&#299;rya); 5.
Suppression of desire (Nekkhamma = naishk&#257;mya), or,
according to some, profound contemplation; 6. Transcendental
wisdom (Pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a = Praj&ntilde;&#257;). To which are
added&mdash;7. Truth (Satya); 8. Steadfast resolution
(Adhish&#7789;h&#257;na); 9. Good-will or kindness (Maitra);
10. Absolute indifference or imperturbability or apathy
(Upeksh&#257;), resulting in a kind of ecstatic quietude.</p>
<p>This kind of memorial tabulation in lists of 4, 5, 7, 8,
10, etc., is of course a product of later Buddhism.</p>
<p>I now give examples from the Dharma-pada:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By oneself is evil done; by oneself is one injured;
by oneself is evil left undone; by oneself is one purified;
no one purifies another.&rsquo; (Compare Manu IV. 240.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better than dominion over the earth, better than
going to Heaven, or having sovereignty over the worlds,
is the attainment of the first step in sanctification.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&lsquo;Not to commit evil, to accumulate merit by good
deeds (kusalassa upasampad&#257;), to purify the heart, this
is the doctrine of the Enlightened&rsquo; (165, 178, 183).</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a frontier town is guarded<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> within and without,
so guard thyself.&rsquo; (Dh. 315.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;He who holds back rising anger like a rolling
chariot, him I call a real driver; any other merely
holds the reins.&rsquo; (Dh. 222. Compare Manu II. 88.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let a man overcome anger by gentleness, let him
overcome the evil by good; the parsimonious by liberality,
the liar by truth.&rsquo; (Dh. 223. Manu VI. 47, 48.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fully enlightened finds no satisfaction even in
heavenly pleasures; but only in suppression of desires.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One by one, little by little, moment by moment, a
wise man frees himself from personal impurities as a
refiner blows away the dross of silver.&rsquo; (Dh. 187, 239.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a treasure laid up in the heart, a treasure
of charity, purity, temperance, soberness. A treasure,
secure, impregnable, that no thief can steal; a treasure
that follows after death. (Compare Manu IV. 241.)
Universal science, all the perfections, supernatural
knowledge, supreme Buddhaship itself this treasure
can procure.&rsquo; (Childers&rsquo; Nidhi-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a.)</p>
<p>The following are some of the blessed states described
in the Mah&#257;ma&#7749;gala-sutta. They prove that Gautama
required married men to discharge their duties faithfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The succouring of mother and father, the cherishing
of child and wife, and the following of a peaceful calling,
this is the greatest blessing&rsquo; (ma&#7749;galam uttamam).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&lsquo;The giving alms, a religious life, aid rendered to
relations, blameless acts, this is the greatest blessing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reverence and humility, contentment and gratefulness,
the hearing of the Law at the right time, this is
the greatest blessing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Patience and lowly speech, association with religious
men, recitation of the Law at the right time, this
is the greatest blessing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Self-mortification and chastity, discernment of the
noble truths, perception of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a, this is the greatest
blessing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the A&#7749;guttara (II. iv. 2) it is said that no adequate
return can be made by children to parents &lsquo;even by
menial service.&rsquo; With Gautama, to honour father and
mother was better than to worship the gods of heaven.</p>
<p>Many other examples might be given. Not only was
a man forbidden to kill, he was never to injure.</p>
<p>Then in the R&#257;jov&#257;da J&#257;taka we have the story of
the one king &lsquo;who overcomes the strong by strength,
the soft by softness, the good by goodness, and the
wicked by wickedness;&rsquo; and of the other king &lsquo;who
conquers anger by calmness, the wicked by goodness,
the stingy by gifts, the liar (alika-v&#257;dinam) by truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other precepts require a man to exercise charity and
respect towards all aged persons, teachers, servants, and
animals. He was to set an example of self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>It is recorded of Gautama Buddha that on one occasion
he plucked out his own eyes, and that on another
he cut off his own head, and that on a third he cut his
own body to pieces to redeem a dove from a hawk.</p>
<p>Yet we repeat that with all this apparently sublime
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
morality no true idea of sin, as displeasing to a Holy
God, was connected with the infraction of the moral
code. Nor did a Buddhist always avoid harming others
from any true reverence for life. He was to cherish
the life of others, but his chief motive was the fear
that by not doing so he would entail the misery of
continuous life on himself; and his chief motive for
avoiding anger was that it was incompatible with
that equanimity, which ought to characterize every
wise man who aimed at the extinction of his own
personality.</p>
<p>The ease with which charitable acts might be performed
is amusingly illustrated by a story told in Huc&rsquo;s
travels in Tibet. A certain zealous fellow-traveller (who
considered that it was quite possible to be at the same
time a good Buddhist and a good Christian) invited the
French missionaries to co-operate with him in performing
charitable acts to commemorate the termination of
a fatiguing journey, especially by providing worn-out
travellers, like themselves, with horses. The missionaries
pleaded their own poverty, but to their surprise
were told that they were only required to draw horses
on paper, which were taken to the edge of a precipice,
thrown up into the air, and, certain formularies being
recited, were carried away by the wind and changed into
real horses by the power of Buddha.</p>
<p>Let us by no means, however, shut our eyes to the
praiseworthy feature of the Buddhist system mentioned
at page <a href="#Page_125">125</a>&mdash;its recognition of the need of inner purity
and sanctification&mdash;an inner Buddhism of the heart,
without which even a monk was no true Buddhist. Of
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
course the Law could be observed superficially without
any real heart-belief or heart-purity.</p>
<p>When the inner heart-condition of a Buddhist is
described, he is said to be walking on one of four paths
(&#263;att&#257;ro Magg&#257;), and is then called Ariyo (= &#256;rya),
&lsquo;worthy of reverence&rsquo; (distinguished from P&#7771;ithag-jana,
&lsquo;an ordinary professing Buddhist&rsquo;). To avoid confounding
these paths with the eightfold path (<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>) it would
be better to speak of them as four stages of inner sanctification.
Dhy&#257;na, &lsquo;meditation,&rsquo; of four kinds, is the
chief means of entering and passing through these stages
(<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>), which once entered can never be abandoned.</p>
<p>The first stage is that of the man&mdash;be he monk or
layman&mdash;who is just converted, by an inner awakening,
to true heart-Buddhism. This man has freed himself
from the first three fetters&mdash;namely, delusion of self,
doubts about the Buddha&rsquo;s doctrine, and dependence
on external rites (<a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>). He is called Sot&#257;panno,
&lsquo;one who has entered the stream&rsquo; (Srota-&#257;panna), <i>inevitably</i>
carrying him onwards&mdash;though not necessarily
in the same body&mdash;to the calm ocean of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a, and
his state is called Sot&#257;patti. He can only be re-born as
a god or man, but not in the four lower births (<a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>).</p>
<p>Mark that the doctrine of &lsquo;perseverance&rsquo; is a remarkable
feature in this phase of the Buddhist system.</p>
<p>The second stage is that of the man who has nearly
freed himself from the first five fetters, but has a
sufficient number left to cause one more birth on the
earth. He is called Sakad-&#257;g&#257;m&#299; (Sak&#7771;id-&#257;g&deg;).</p>
<p>The third stage is that of the man who is quite free
from the first five fetters. Such a man can only be
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
re-born in a Brahm&#257; heaven, from which he reaches
Nirv&#257;&#7751;a. He is therefore called An-&#257;g&#257;m&#299;, &lsquo;one who
will not come back to earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fourth stage is that of the completely freed
man who attains Arhatship (Arahatta&#7747;) in this life, and
will at death experience no re-birth. There is, of course,
a difference between one who has only just entered each
stage of the journey and one who has reached the
terminus. And this Arhatship is open to all (even to
women), though only likely to be attained by true
monks or true nuns. The name Arhat (P&#257;li Arah&#257;, in
Ceylon Rahat), &lsquo;most deserving&rsquo; (root <i>arh</i>), is significant
of the highest merit; for the Arhat is perfect,
freed from all pain (nishkle&#7777;a), from all the ten fetters,
from all attachment to existence (up&#257;d&#257;na) whether on
earth or in heaven, and from all re-creative Act-force.
He has already entered Nirv&#257;&#7751;a, and while still living
he is dead to the world. He is the J&#299;van-mukta, &lsquo;emancipated
living man,&rsquo; of the Yoga. By the force of the
fourth Dhy&#257;na, he has gained the Abhij&ntilde;&#257;s (Abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;),
or &lsquo;transcendent faculties of knowledge,&rsquo; the inner eye,
inner ear, knowledge of all thoughts, and recollection of
previous existences, and the extraordinary powers over
matter called Iddhi (= &#7770;iddhi). In short he is Asekha,
&lsquo;one who has nothing to learn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Although, theoretically, a layman and even beings
existing in other spheres, might enter the stream leading
to Arhatship (see <a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>) without becoming monks,
yet it is evident that as a rule it was only likely to
be entered by persons who renounced the world and
led a celibate monastic life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>But of Arhats there are three grades:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, the simple Arhat (described above), who has
attained perfection through his own efforts and the
doctrine and example of a supreme Buddha, but is not
himself such a Buddha, and cannot teach others how to
attain Arhatship, though he associates with others.</p>
<p>Secondly, and second in rank, but far above the
simple Arhat, the Pratyeka-Buddha or Solitary Saint,
who has attained perfection for himself and by himself
alone, and not as a member of any monastic Order, nor
through the teaching of any supreme Buddha (except in
some former birth). This solitary hermit-like Arhat&mdash;a
kind of concentration of isolated or selfish sanctity&mdash;is
symbolized by a rhinoceros. He does not appear on
earth at the same time with a supreme Buddha, and
has not the same epithets (<a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>) applied to him.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the supreme Buddha or Buddha <i>par excellence</i>
(once a Bodhi-sattva), who, having by his own self-enlightening
insight attained perfect knowledge (sambodhi),
and having, by the practice of the transcendent
virtues (<a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>) and through extinction of the passions
and of all desire for life, become entitled to that complete
extinction of bodily existence (pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a), in which the
perfection of all Arhatship must end, has yet delayed
this consummation that he may become the Saviour of a
suffering world&mdash;not in the same manner as the God-sent
Saviour of Christianity, but by teaching men how to save
themselves. This is the supreme Buddha, the founder
of the whole monastic Order, immeasurably superior
both to Pratyeka-Buddhas and to all mere Arhats.</p>
<p>He said of himself (Mah&#257;-vagga I. 6, 8),&mdash;&lsquo;I am the
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
all-subduer (sabb&#257;bhibh&#363;); the all-wise; I have no
stains; through myself I possess knowledge; I have no
rival (pa&#7789;ipuggalo); I am the chief Arhat&mdash;the highest
teacher; I alone am the absolutely wise (Sambuddha);
I am the Conqueror (Jina); all the fires of desire are
quenched (s&#299;tibh&#363;to) in me; I have Nirv&#257;&#7751;a (nibbuto).&rsquo;
See <a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a> of this volume.</p>
<p>This seems a marvellous assumption on the part of
one who never claimed to be other than a man; yet he
had taken the idea from Br&#257;hmanism, which held that
its saints could surpass all gods (Brahm&#259; only excepted).</p>
<p>Such supreme Buddhas, who are perfect knowers,
and also perfect teachers of the truth, are only manifested
on the earth at long intervals of time.</p>
<p>Gautama is the fourth Buddha of the present age
(Bhadra-Kalpa). He was a Kshatriya; his three
mythical predecessors&mdash;Kraku-&#263;&#263;handa, Kanaka-muni,
and K&#257;&#7777;yapa&mdash;having been sons of Br&#257;hmans. He is to
be followed by the fifth Buddha, Maitreya (a name meaning
&lsquo;full of love towards all beings&rsquo;), but not until the
doctrine of Gautama has passed out of men&rsquo;s memory
after five thousand years (<a href="#Page_181">p. 181</a>). In their previous
existences Gautama and his predecessors were, (see pp.
98, 112,) Bodhi-sattvas<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a>, &lsquo;beings who have knowledge
(derived from intellect) for their essence,&rsquo; a name borne
by all destined to become supreme Buddhas as well as
by the first of Gautama&rsquo;s successors, Maitreya.</p>
<p>This coming Buddha is, as we shall see hereafter,
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
an object of universal reverence among later Buddhists
of all sects as a kind of expected Messiah or Saviour.
Often, indeed, he is more honoured than Gautama himself,
because he is interested in the present order of
things, as well as in the future, while Gautama Buddha
and all his predecessors have passed away into non-being.</p>
<p>Twenty-four mythical Buddhas (the first being
D&#299;pa&#7747;kara, &lsquo;Light-causer&rsquo;) are held to have appeared<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a>
before Gautama in preceding cycles of time. Many
particulars about them are given, including their birth-places,
the length of their lives and their statures.
Gautama himself is said to have met some of them
during his transmigrations. Even the trees under which
they achieved supreme wisdom are enumerated.</p>
<p>Sometimes the last six of the twenty-four are reckoned
with Gautama Buddha as constituting seven principal
Buddhas<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a>, who seem to have been grouped together
to correspond with the Br&#257;hmanical seven Manus of the
present Kalpa. Usually, however, Gautama is held to
be the last of twenty-five Buddhas.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, the principal lines of Buddhist moral
teaching all converge to one focus&mdash;to the perfected
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Arhat or rather to a still brighter point of light in the
perfect Buddha waiting for his reward&mdash;the nectar
of the eternal state of complete Nirv&#257;&#7751;a.</p>
<p>And this compels us to attempt some explanation of
Nirv&#257;&#7751;a. In the first place forty-six synonyms of it
are given in the Abhidh&#257;nappad&#299;pik&#257;, e.g. Mokkha or
Mutti, &lsquo;deliverance,&rsquo; Nirodha, &lsquo;cessation,&rsquo; Ta&#7753;hakkhaya
(t&#7771;ish&#7751;&#257;-kshaya), &lsquo;destruction of lust,&rsquo; Ar&#363;pa, Khema,
Kevala, Apavagga, &lsquo;emancipation,&rsquo; Nibbuti (= nirv&#7771;iti),
&lsquo;quietude,&rsquo; Amata (Am&#7771;ita), &lsquo;deathless nectar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following is from Rhys Davids&rsquo; J&#257;taka (p. 4):
&lsquo;One day the wise Sumedh&#257; fell a-thinking, thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Grievous
is re-birth in a new existence, and the dissolution
of the body in each successive place where we
are re-born. I am subject to birth, to decay, to disease,
to death. It is right, being such, that I should strive
to attain the great deathless Nirv&#257;&#7751;a, which is tranquil,
and free from birth, decay, sickness, grief, and joy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;For as in this world there is pleasure&mdash;the opposite
of pain&mdash;so where there is existence there must be its
opposite, the cessation of existence; and as where
there is heat there is also cold which neutralizes it, so
there must be a Nirv&#257;&#7751;a that extinguishes (the fires
of) lust and the other passions; and as in opposition
to a bad and evil condition there is a good and blameless
one, so where there is evil Birth there must also be
Nirv&#257;&#7751;a, called the Birthless, because it puts an end to
all re-birth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Just as a man who has fallen into a heap of filth,
if he beholds afar off a great pond covered with lotuses
of five colours, ought to seek that pond, saying, &lsquo;By
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
what way shall I arrive there?&rsquo; but if he does not seek
it, the fault is not that of the pond; even so where
there is the lake of the great deathless Nirv&#257;&#7751;a.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>What, then, is the proper definition of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a
(P&#257;li Nibb&#257;na)? In venturing on an explanation of
so controverted a term, I feel rather like a foolhardy
person walking barefoot over thorny ground. Nevertheless
I may fearlessly assert two things about it.</p>
<p>The first is, that the term Nirv&#257;&#7751;a was not originated
by Gautama. It was an expression common to both
Br&#257;hmanism and Buddhism, and most of its synonyms
such as moksha, apavarga, and nirv&#7771;iti are still common
to both. It was current in Gautama&rsquo;s time, and certainly
occurs in the Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata, parts of which are
of great antiquity.</p>
<p>In the celebrated episode of that poem called Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a>,
V. 24, we find the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Yog&#299; who is internally happy, internally satisfied
and internally illumined, attains extinction in the
Supreme Being, and becomes that Being&rsquo; (Yo &rsquo;nta&#7717;sukho
&lsquo;ntar&#257;r&#257;mas tath&#257;ntarjyotir eva ya&#7717;, | Sa Yog&#299; Brahma-nirv&#257;&#7751;a&#7747;<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a>
Brahma-bh&#363;to &rsquo;dhiga&#263;&#263;hati).</p>
<p>The second point is that it would be about as unreasonable
to expect that Nirv&#257;&#7751;a should always be
explained in one way as to restrict Br&#257;hmanism
and Buddhism&mdash;two most elastic, comprehensive, and
Protean systems, which have constantly changed their
front to suit changing circumstances and varying national
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
peculiarities at different epochs and in different
countries&mdash;to one hard and fast outline.</p>
<p>It is certainly singular that although the term
Nibb&#257;na (Sansk&#7771;it Nirv&#257;&#7751;a)&mdash;like some of the crucial
theological terms of Christianity&mdash;has led to endless
discussions, it does not occur often in the P&#257;li texts.
The word Arahattam, &lsquo;Arhatship,&rsquo; is more common.</p>
<p>Nirv&#257;&#7751;a, of course, originally means &lsquo;the state of a
blown-out flame.&rsquo; Hence its first meaning is properly
restricted to the complete extinction of the three chief
fires<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> of lust, ill-will, and delusion, and a total cessation
of all evil passions and desires<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a>, especially of the desire
for individual existence (name and form).</p>
<p>Following on this is the state of release from all
pain and from all ignorance, accompanied by a sense of
profound rest&mdash;a state achieved by all Arhats while
still living in the world<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a>, and notably by the Buddha
at the moment when he attained Buddhahood, forty-five
years before his final Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a. Nirv&#257;&#7751;a then
is not necessarily the annihilation of all existence.
It is the absence of kle&#7777;a (<a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>), as in the Yoga
system, and corresponds very much to the Br&#257;hmanical
Apavarga, described in the Ny&#257;ya, and defined by a commentator,
V&#257;tsy&#257;yana, to be Sarva-du&#7717;kha-&#263;heda (&lsquo;the
cutting off of all pain&rsquo;). In short, it is Arhatship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>But besides Nirv&#257;&#7751;a we have the expression Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a.
This is not merely the blowing out of the
fires of the passions but also the entire cessation of re-births,
with extinction of all the elements or seeds of
bodily existence. This took place when the Buddha
died or &lsquo;passed away&rsquo; after innumerable previous deaths.
Practically, however, in Buddhism the death of every
ordinary being amounts to this kind of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a; for, if
there is no recollection of any former state of existence
in the new being created by Karma, what is every
death but utter personal extinction?</p>
<p>Now with regard to the Nirv&#257;&#7751;a of Arhatship, no
one can have come in contact with the natives of
India in their own country, without observing that for
a genuine aristocratic Br&#257;hman to allow others to see
him give way to any passion, to exhibit any emotion
or enthusiasm, is regarded as a proof of weakness.</p>
<p>We can easily understand, therefore, that when
the Buddha exhorted his followers to strive after a
wholly impassive condition, he addressed a sympathetic
audience.</p>
<p>Long before his exhortations were heard in India,
his fellow-countrymen held persons in the highest respect
who claimed to have entirely suppressed their
passions. The only peculiarity in Gautama&rsquo;s teaching
was that he made this object incumbent on all true
Buddhists alike, without exception. And this state of
absolute imperturbability is well indicated to the eye by
the usual attitude of the images which, after Gautama&rsquo;s
death, were carved to represent him&mdash;an attitude of
passionless composure, and dignified calm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>In the interesting P&#257;li work Milinda-pra&#7777;na (Milinda-pa&ntilde;ho),
containing a conversation on the subject of
Nirv&#257;&#7751;a between King Milinda (Menander) and the
monk N&#257;gasena (supposed to have lived about 140 <span class="small">B.C.</span>),
the latter compares it to the pure water which quenches
fire, and to the fathomless Ocean freed from trouble and
impurities, which no river, however vast, can fill to
overflowing; and to the Air, which cannot be seen or
explained, though it enters our bodies and fills us with
life; and to Space, which is eternal and infinite, and
beyond the power of man to conceive.</p>
<p>I trust I shall not shock my Indian friends if I illustrate
this condition by a comparison of my own drawn
from the animal creation. In crossing the Indian
Ocean, when unruffled by the slightest breeze, I have
sometimes observed a jelly-fish floating on the surface
of the transparent water, apparently lifeless. The
creature is evidently neither asleep nor awake. It
certainly is not thinking about anything, and its consciousness
is doubtful. All that can be affirmed about
it is that it seems to be drinking in the warm fluid in
a state of lazy blissful repose.</p>
<p>No Buddhist, at least, could look at such a sight without
being reminded of this idea of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a&mdash;the idea
of, so to speak, floating in perfect repose and peace and
cessation from all pain, and all work, and even all
thought, on a kind of ocean of half conscious, half unconscious
beatitude. It is not consciousness, neither is it
unconsciousness. It is symbolized by a full-blown, perfectly
formed lotus&mdash;a frequent emblem of perfection&mdash;reposing
on a calm mirror-like lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>With regard to Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a>&mdash;the complete termination
of migrations and passing away of all the elements
of bodily existence&mdash;if this is to be distinguished from
the Br&#257;hmanical idea of absorption into an impersonal
spirit&mdash;whereby the Ego of personal identity is destroyed&mdash;it
is a distinction without much difference.</p>
<p>Strictly, however, in Buddhism the dissolution of the
body leaves no surviving personality or individuality,
and consequently Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a is not properly described
either as absorption into a void (&#7777;&#363;nya) or as annihilation.
It is simply the absolute termination of a series
of conscious bodily organizations. The Buddha himself
evaded dogmatic definitions, and would probably have
said:&mdash;it is not life, neither is it non-life; it may be
compared to infinite space (&#7777;&#363;nya) which is not to be
comprehended or explained.</p>
<p>We should also bear in mind that although Nirv&#257;&#7751;a
and Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a constitute the ultimate goal to which
all the morality of a true Buddhist tends, they have no
place either in the aims or thoughts of the ordinary
adherents of Buddhism at the present day.</p>
<p>The apex of all the desires, the culminating point of
all the ambition of the most religiously-minded Buddhists
of modern times, points to a life in one of the
heavens, while the great mass of the people aim only
at escaping one of the hells, and elevating themselves to
a higher condition of bodily existence in their next birth
on this earth, and perhaps on that very part of this earth
which is the scene of their present toils, joys, and sorrows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>It only remains for me to caution those who may be
impressed with the beauty of some of the precepts
of the moral code and its theory of perfection, as
ending in Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a, against deducing therefrom
too optimistic an estimate of the Buddhist system.
Buddhist morality is like a showy edifice built on the
sand. It is a thoroughly fair-weather structure, incapable
of standing against flood, storm, and tempest.</p>
<p>It may be summed up in a few words as a scheme
for the establishing of a paradox&mdash;for the perfecting of
one&rsquo;s self by accumulating merit with the ultimate view
of annihilating all consciousness of self&mdash;a system which
teaches the greatest respect for the life of others, with
the ultimate view of extinguishing one&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>It must, in short, be clearly understood that if any
comparison be instituted between Buddhism and Christianity
in regard to the self-abnegation, or self-sacrifice
which each claims to inculcate, the self to be got rid
of in Buddhism is not the selfishness condemned by
Christianity, but rather the self of individuality&mdash;the
self of individual life, and personal identity.</p>
<p>To be righteous in a Christian sense a man must
be God-like, and to be righteous in a Buddhistic sense
a man must be Buddha-like; but the righteousness
of the Buddhist is not the perfection of holiness by the
extinction of sin committed against God, but the
perfection of merit-making, with the view of earning
happiness for himself in a higher state hereafter.</p>
<p>For every Buddhist is like a trader who keeps a
ledger, with a regular debtor and creditor account, and
a daily entry of profit and loss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>He must not take, make, or hoard money. He is
forbidden to store up a money-balance in a worldly bank,
but he is urged to be constantly accumulating a merit-balance
in the bank of Karma.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let the Buddha enforce his own moral
teaching in his own way, by allegory and illustration
drawn from real life:&mdash;When asked by a Br&#257;hman
&lsquo;why he did not plough and sow and earn his own
bread?&rsquo; he replied to the following effect: &lsquo;I do
plough and sow and eat immortal fruit (Amata =
Am&#7771;ita); my plough is wisdom (pa&#7751;&#7751;&#257;); my shaft is
modesty; my draught-ox, exertion; my goad, earnest
meditation (sati); my mind, the rein. Faith (saddh&#257;)
in the doctrine is the seed I sow; cleaving to life is the
weed I root up; truth is the destroyer of the weed; Nirv&#257;&#7751;a
and deliverance from misery are my harvest.&rsquo;
(Kasi-bh&#257;radv&#257;ja-sutta of the Sutta-nip&#257;ta.)</p>
<p>This may be compared with St. Luke viii. 11-15; but
have we not here a contrast rather than a comparison?</p>
<p>Perhaps some may think that the contrast is not
unfavourable to Buddhism. Nay, possibly some may
complain that I have not enlarged sufficiently on
the remarkable resemblance between certain moral
precepts in the Buddhist code and in the Christian.
I admit this resemblance&mdash;I admit that both tell us:&mdash;not
to love the world; not to love money; not to
show enmity towards our enemies; not to do unrighteous
or impure acts&mdash;to overcome evil by good,
and to do to others as we would be done by.</p>
<p>Nay, I admit even more:&mdash;I allow that some
Buddhist precepts go beyond the corresponding
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
Christian injunctions. For Buddhism prohibits all
killing&mdash;even of animals and noxious insects. It
demands total abstinence from stimulating drinks&mdash;disallowing
even moderation in their use. It excludes
all who aim at perfect sanctity from the holy
estate of matrimony. It bids a man, if he strives
after perfection, abandon the world and lead a life of
monkhood. In fine, its morality is essentially a monkhood-morality.
It enjoins total abstinence, because it
dares not trust human beings to be temperate. How
indeed could it trust them when it promises them no
help, no divine grace, no restraining power?</p>
<p>The glory of Christianity is that having freely given
that grace and that power to man, it trusts him to
make use of the gift. It seems to speak to him thus:&mdash;Thy
Creator wills to trust thee and to be trusted by
thee; He has endowed thee with freedom of choice,
and therefore respects thy liberty of action. He imposes
no rule of total abstinence in regard to natural
desires; He simply bids thee keep them within bounds,
so that thy moderation may be known unto all men;
He places thee in the world amid trials and temptations
and says to thee, &lsquo;My grace is sufficient for
thee&rsquo; and by its aid thou mayest overcome them all.</p>
<p>Yes, the grand difference between the morality of
Buddhism and the morality of Christianity is not in
the letter of the precepts, but in the principle and
motive power brought to bear on their application.</p>
<p>Buddhism says:&mdash;Be righteous by yourselves, and
through yourselves, and for the getting rid of all life in
yourselves. Christianity says:&mdash;Be righteous through
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
the power of God&rsquo;s gift of eternal life in His Son.
In a word, Buddhism founds its morality on self.
Christianity founds its morality on Christ.</p>
<p>The Buddha said to his followers:&mdash;Take nothing
from me, trust to no one but to yourselves.</p>
<p>Christ said, and says to us still:&mdash;Take all from
me; take this free gift. Put on this spotless robe.
Eat this Bread of Life. Drink this Living Water.</p>
<p>Think you that any one who receives a priceless
gift, is likely willingly to insult the Giver of it?
Think you that any one who accepts a snow-white
robe is likely willingly to soil it by impure acts?
Think you that any one who tastes life-giving Bread
is likely to relish husks? or that any one who draws
deep draughts at a living Well is likely to prefer the
polluted water of a stagnant pool?</p>
<p>Beware, then, of judging by the mere letter; or,
should you insist on so judging, bear in mind that
everywhere the Buddha&rsquo;s Law is a dead letter, because
the Buddha is dead; just as the Sermon on the Mount
would be a dead letter, if Christ were dead.</p>
<p>Finally, let me say to the admirers of Buddhism:&mdash;</p>
<p>If you insist on placing its moral code on the same
level with that of Christianity, ask yourselves one
plain question&mdash;Who would be the more likely to lead
a godly, righteous, and sober life, a life of moderation
and temperance, a life of holiness and happiness&mdash;the
man who has learnt his morality from the dead, the
extinct Buddha, or the man who draws his morality
and his holiness from the living, the eternal, the life-giving
Christ?</p>

<h2 id="c12">LECTURE VII.
<br /><i>Changes in Buddhism and its disappearance from India.</i></h2>
<p>In the preceding Lectures I have confined myself
chiefly to the consideration of what may be called <i>true
Buddhism</i> as taught by its Founder and developed by
his immediate followers and disciples during the first
two or three centuries of its existence in the land of
its birth, India.</p>
<p>To attempt an explanation of all the subsequent
phases of Buddhism would, as I have before stated, require
the command of unlimited time. All I can hope
to accomplish in the concluding Lectures is to give
a very general idea of the nature of the changes Buddhism
underwent before it died out in India, and of its
corruptions in some of the countries bordering on India
and in North-eastern Asia.</p>
<p>And I may add that those who desire correct views
on this subject, ought not to trust to mere inferences
and theories founded on a critical perusal of the so-called
Sacred Books of the Buddhists. For it is certain
that without any practical experience of what Buddhism
has become in modern times&mdash;I mean such an experience
as can only be gained by residing or travelling
in countries where Buddhism now prevails&mdash;the mere
study of its ancient scriptures is likely to be misleading.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>At the same time book-knowledge is indispensable,
and it is essential to bring to the study of later Buddhism
a scholarlike acquaintance with Sansk&#7771;it and P&#257;li.
Even a knowledge of Tibetan ought to be added.
Nor ought the inquirer to be ignorant of the science of
comparative religion, seeing that the principles of that
science may throw light on many difficult questions.</p>
<p>For example, a student of comparative religion will
be prepared to expect that all religious systems will
diverge more or less from their original type in the
hands of enthusiastic disciples, who are ever inclined to
amplify their master&rsquo;s teaching and to explain it differently
according to each man&rsquo;s peculiar temperament
and mental bias, until in the end the original deposit
of simple doctrine becomes overlaid with layer upon
layer of adventitious matter.</p>
<p>Nor will he be surprised to find that the tendency
of every religious movement is towards deterioration
and disintegration. Nor will it appear strange to him
that the chief conservative force is antagonism. As
time goes on disagreements among the followers of any
great leader seem to be inevitable, and always lead to
sectarian divisions and subdivisions. Yet it is this
opposition of religious parties that usually operates to
mitigate the worst extremes of corruption, and tends to
bring about re-forming movements.</p>
<p>Even the progress of Christianity&mdash;as history shows
too well&mdash;furnishes illustrations of the law of deterioration,
disintegration, and re-formation. At all events,
it is certain that no study of the New Testament is
likely to give a true idea of the varying condition of
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
the Christian religion as exhibited at the present day
in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>But here it is important to caution the student of
religions against forcing a comparison between two
systems of doctrine like Christianity and Buddhism,
which are radically and essentially opposed to each other.</p>
<p>The unchristianlike incrustations and divisions which
have marred the original teaching of the Head of our
religion exist <i>in spite</i> of Christianity. They are not
the result of any development of its first principles;
whereas, on the contrary, the corruptions and schisms
of Buddhism are the natural and inevitable outcome
of its own root-ideas and fundamental doctrines.</p>
<p>In proof of this let us revert for a moment to the
insight we have gained into the origin of Buddhism.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the most remarkable feature
of the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, so far as it has been stated in
the preceding Lectures, was that he altogether ignored
the existence in human nature of any spiritual aspirations,
affections, or instincts higher than or distinct
from the natural aspirations, affections, and instincts of
humanity; and of any force outside of human nature
capable of aiding a man&rsquo;s own efforts in his struggle
for salvation. Not that he reviled, or poured contempt
on the religion prevalent among his fellow-countrymen,
but that he found no place in his system for an external
Ruler and Controller of the Universe, and would have
stultified his own teaching had he acknowledged a
Supreme Creator, guiding and upholding all things by
His will, and always at hand to co-operate with His
creatures and listen to their supplications.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>If it were possible, in short, to condense into a categorical
statement the scattered utterances of a man
whose teaching was rarely dogmatic, we might affirm
that it was to the effect that for any man to depend on
a Being higher than himself, or to centre the noblest
affections of his nature on a merciful, just, and holy
God, whose presence he yearned for, whose aid he prayed
for, and to whose image he longed to be assimilated&mdash;was
a mere delusion, though perhaps a harmless one.
He therefore set aside every supposed supernatural
revelation as useless and incapable of proof. He prescribed
no prayer, he enjoined no form of worship, he
established no real church, and instead of a priesthood
or clergy, ordained to aid men in their progress heavenwards
or to console them in the trials of life, he founded
an Order of Monks pledged to denounce human life as
not worth living, and bound to abstain from all participation
in human affairs.</p>
<p>It is true that he deserves commendation for having
substituted moral conduct for useless superstitious
rites, but his moral code had no other aim than the
suppression of lusts and desires (<a href="#fn_59">p. 139, note 2</a>), and his
peculiar stoical philosophy had no other object than the
removal of the ignorance which obstructed the path to
true knowledge&mdash;the knowledge that all life is fraught
with pain and misery, and not worth perpetuating.</p>
<p>It is admitted, too, that its moral precepts were of
a high order; but it promised man no divine aid in
observing them, it supplied him with no motive power
except the selfish hope of benefiting himself in future
states of corporeal existence, and it provided no remedy
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
in case his attempts to obey its injunctions ended in
failure. How, indeed, could it do any of these things
when its only idea of sin was not the infraction of God&rsquo;s
law, but the commission of an act fraught with evil
consequences to the doer?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was guilty of the inconsistency of
bidding a man cherish a fellow-feeling for others and
diligently engage in all good works, while it made his
true salvation depend on his giving up all love for wife
and children, and setting before himself, as his final
goal, a condition of absolute indifference and inactivity.</p>
<p>What, therefore, I am at present concerned to point
out is that, if the essential doctrines of primitive Buddhism
were of the character thus summarized, a rebound
from one extreme to another became inevitable, and
that such a reaction was due to the very nature of the
original teaching of its Founder. In point of fact it
was not a development that took place, but a recoil&mdash;like
the recoil of a spring held down for a time by
a powerful hand and then released. And this resulted
from the simple working of the eternal instincts of
humanity, which insisted on making themselves felt
notwithstanding the unnatural restraint to which the
Buddha had subjected them; so that every doctrine he
taught developed by a kind of irony of fate into a
complete contradiction of itself.</p>
<p>Let us take a few examples:&mdash;</p>
<p>Buddhism, we know, started with the doctrine that
all idea of marriage, or of happy home-life, was to
be abandoned by wise men&mdash;by all who aimed at
becoming true Buddhists (in direct contradistinction,
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
we may note, to the primary Christian truth that it
is not good for created man to be alone, and that therefore
his Creator created a help meet for him&mdash;a truth
confirmed in a remarkable manner by the Founder of
the Christian Church when He gave the first sign of
His divine commission at a marriage ceremony).</p>
<p>What, then, followed on the Buddha&rsquo;s original unnatural
teaching in regard to marriage?</p>
<p>Of course an immediate result was that, although
according to the Buddha&rsquo;s ordinance any one who aimed
at perfect sanctity was bound to lead a celibate life, the
rule against marriage was admitted to be inapplicable
to the majority of human beings living in the world.
The mass of the people, in short, were necessarily
offenders against the primary law of Buddhism. Though
called lay-Buddhists, they were not &lsquo;wise men&rsquo; in the
Buddhist sense of the term (pp. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>, <a href="#Page_88">88</a>). There is even
evidence that among certain monkish communities
in Northern countries the law against marriage was
soon relaxed. It is well known that at the present day
Lamaseries in Sikkim and Tibet swarm with the children
of monks, though called their nephews and nieces<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a>. And
far worse than this, Buddhism ultimately allied itself
with T&#257;ntrism or the worship of the female principle
(&#7777;akti), and under its sanction encouraged the grossest
violations of decency and the worst forms of profligacy.</p>
<p>It was the same in regard to the unnatural vow of
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
poverty. Monasteries and Lamaseries now possess immense
revenues, and monks are often wealthy men.</p>
<p>Then again, what resulted from the Buddha&rsquo;s ignoring
the existence of a God, and telling his disciples
to abstain from depending on any Being higher than
what man himself could become? Of course this was
opposed to every man&rsquo;s innermost sense of his own
needs and of his own nature. For man is so constituted
that he cannot be happy without loving and trusting
a Being higher than himself&mdash;a Being who takes the
initiative in loving His creatures and is the proper
object of their loftiest affections. Nor can man in his
secret heart regard either himself or any one of his
fellow-men as a being worthy of his highest adoration.
Nor can he set his affections on a blank or an abstraction.
And so, in spite of the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, his followers
would act on their own convictions. They would believe
in beings higher than themselves, and in a personal
Creator knowable and lovable by themselves, and knowing
and loving His creatures. Nay, they ultimately
converted the Buddha himself into the very God he
denied, calling him &lsquo;The chief god of all the gods&rsquo;
(Dev&#257;tideva).</p>
<p>Again, what was the effect of the Buddha&rsquo;s leading
men to believe that all supernatural revelation was unneeded&mdash;that
all enlightenment came from within, and
that every man was competent to think out true knowledge
for himself by the exercise of his own reasoning
powers, in the way that the Buddha himself had done?</p>
<p>Of course the result was that the generality of men
who shrank from the effort of thinking out truth for
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
themselves, and were wholly destitute of any faculty
for doing so, insisted on believing in a revelation from
an external power, and ended in attributing infallibility
to the Buddha&rsquo;s own teaching, and worshipping the
Law of Buddhism&mdash;as a visible embodiment of their
deceased teacher&mdash;with all the ardour of enthusiastic
bibliolatrists.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what followed on the Buddha&rsquo;s denying
that any prayer, however earnest, could have any
power to modify the operation of natural laws?</p>
<p>Of course men longed for some form of supplication
to a higher power, and so the Buddha&rsquo;s disciples not
only composed prayer-formularies, but invested the
mere letters and syllables of such forms with an efficacy
which no other body of religionists has ever thought
of attributing to prayer of any kind.</p>
<p>They not only repeated mystical sentences, which
were called prayers, though really mere charms, believing
that an occult virtue was inherent in the
words, but invented a method of manufacturing such
sentences (Dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#299;) like marketable commodities.</p>
<p>They fabricated prayers, in fact, by machinery, inscribing
them on wheels or on rolls inserted in cylinders,
which in the present day are made to revolve by hand
or by the force of water and wind, and will possibly,
with the spread of science, be impelled by steam-power,
so that each revolution may count for an infinite
number of repetitions, and be set down to the
credit of the owner or manager of the mechanism.</p>
<p>Yet again, what was the inevitable consequence of
the Buddha&rsquo;s rejection of the doctrine that any benefit
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
could accrue to human beings from religious services
conducted by regularly ordained priests, and of his
instituting in their stead an Order of Monks, who were
little better than a community of drones, contributing
nothing to the wealth of the world, doing nothing of
any utility to any one, and taught to regard inaction
as the path of true wisdom?</p>
<p>Naturally, men craved for spiritual helpers, guides,
and intercessors, and so by degrees these very monks
conducted elaborate religious services, and a complicated
hierarchy was organized in Tibet, even more
intricate and far-reaching in its ramifications than that
of the modern Romish Church.</p>
<p>And once more, what resulted from the Buddha&rsquo;s
objection to provide visible images and material objects
of worship, with a view to stimulate devotion or aid
meditation?</p>
<p>Of course concrete and objective Buddhism of some
kind became a necessity. It became essential to make
concessions to the weakness and infirmity of human
nature, which required external aids, and declined to
be devoted to an ideal void, or to meditate on a pure
abstraction. Even the Founder of Buddhism himself
seems to have felt, as we shall see, that his hold on the
memory of his followers would depend on their venerating
certain objects and symbols after his death. Unhappily
for the purity of Buddhism, but quite in conformity
with the inveterate tendencies of humanity,
the Buddha&rsquo;s disciples pushed veneration of external
objects to an extreme. They were not contented with
mere reverence shown to the relics of the Buddha&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
burnt body and the shrines containing them. They
worshipped the tree under which he attained Buddhahood,
the seat on which he sat, the prints of his feet,
his shadow supposed to be impressed on rocks, the
utensils he used, the books containing the Law, the
wheel which symbolized both the propagation and
the character of his doctrine, and finally bowed down
before carved representations of his body and images of
all kinds. It is remarkable that in Buddhist countries
idols are far more numerous than among any other
idolatrous people in the world.</p>
<p>Lastly, what resulted from the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching
that the ultimate end to which men&rsquo;s efforts ought to
be directed was Nirv&#257;&#7751;a&mdash;that is, the total extinction
of all individual existence and personal identity?</p>
<p>Of course men instinctively recoiled from utter self-annihilation,
and so the Buddha&rsquo;s followers ended in
changing the true idea of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a and converting it
from a condition of non-existence into a state of hazy
beatitude in celestial regions, while they encouraged
all men&mdash;whether monks or laymen&mdash;to make a sense
of dreamy bliss in heaven, and not total extinction of
life, the end of all their efforts.</p>
<p>But it was not only this natural and inevitable
recoil to the opposite extreme that ultimately brought
about an entire change in primitive Buddhism. Another
cause must also be taken into account.</p>
<p>We have already explained the nature of the tie
which bound Buddhism to Br&#257;hmanism, from the first
day on which Gautama sat as a disciple at the feet of
the Br&#257;hman philosophers Udraka and &#256;&#7735;&#257;ra (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
Now, although this tie was soon loosened, and although
the Buddha struck out a line of his own, and a separation
took place, yet the two systems stood on so much common
ground that they were always ready to draw
together again.</p>
<p>At all events, it is probable that one system never
expelled the other, and that the constant attrition
and contact which took place between Br&#257;hmanism
and Buddhism, led to a considerable splitting up of the
original fabric of Buddhism, involving, of course, many
divisions and subdivisions of Buddhistic thought, some
of which were closely allied to the later developments
of Br&#257;hmanical philosophy.</p>
<p>In the Sarva-dar&#7777;ana-sa&#7749;graha four principal sects
of Buddhism are enumerated, which must have taken
root early on Indian soil.</p>
<p>These four were the Vaibh&#257;shika, Sautr&#257;ntika, M&#257;dhyamika,
and Yog&#257;&#263;&#257;ra. Of these the first two with
their subdivisions<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> were realistic, and were established&mdash;though
not perhaps thoroughly formulated and
systematized&mdash;in very early times, long before the
council of Kanishka; while the two later schools are
described as idealistic, the M&#257;dhyamika being a Buddhistic
form of the Ved&#257;nta philosophy, and the Yog&#257;&#263;&#257;ra
agreeing generally with the Yoga system.</p>
<p>Indeed there is good evidence that Buddhism developed
in India a greater number of schools and phases
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
of thought than Br&#257;hmanism itself. Some authorities
enumerate eighteen divisions (corresponding perhaps
to the eighteen original disciples, pp. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>-73) which
existed in king Kanishka&rsquo;s time&mdash;that is, in the first
century of our era, while others specify thirty-two; and
in the fourth century we find the Chinese traveller
F&#257;-hien (<a href="#Page_160">p. 160</a>) making allusion to as many as ninety-six
(Dr. Legge&rsquo;s translation, p. 62).</p>
<p>We cannot wonder then that the author of the
Sarva-dar&#7777;ana-sa&#7749;graha expressed himself in rather
strong language to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Though the venerated Buddha be the only one
teacher, his disciples are manifold; just as when the
sun has set, the thief and other evil doers, the theological
student and others understand that it is time
to set about their occupations, according to their
several inclinations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet, after all, it was chiefly in the North, and in
consequence of the council held by Kanishka, India&rsquo;s
greatest Buddhist king after A&#7777;oka<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> (see <a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>), that
the original features of Buddhism underwent the
greatest change and became overlaid with coating after
coating of extraneous matter. It was there, in Northern
regions, in the valley of the Indus, that the Protean
system called Mah&#257;-y&#257;na arose, and grew, by the operation
of the usual laws of accretion, conglomeration,
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
disintegration, and reintegration, into a congeries of
heterogeneous doctrines, including the worship of
Bodhi-sattvas, deified saints, and personal gods.</p>
<p>Naturally the adherents of this wider method spoke
disparagingly of the simpler system prevalent in the
South, whose sacred books were the Tri-pi&#7789;aka of
Ceylon written in the ancient vernacular (P&#257;li). That
system they designated H&#299;na-y&#257;na, &lsquo;the defective
method,&rsquo; not denying however that their own enlarged
system grew out of and included the simpler one.</p>
<p>There arose, too, a third method, or &lsquo;vehicle&rsquo; of
salvation, called &lsquo;the middle method&rsquo; (Madhyama-y&#257;na).
This, however, is not so well known, and, being a compromise
between the other two, never gained many
adherents, though it is still recognized in Tibet&mdash;the
Tibetans often speaking of Tri-y&#257;na, or &lsquo;the three
vehicles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At all events, it is only necessary for practical purposes
to recognize the distinction of the Great and Little
Vehicle&mdash;the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> and the H&#299;na-y&#257;na. And it
may be stated generally that the inhabitants of Nep&#257;l,
Tibet, China, Manchuria, Mongolia, and Japan have
always shown a preference for the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na, or
&lsquo;Great Vehicle,&rsquo; while the people of Ceylon, Burma,
and Siam have always preferred the &lsquo;Little Vehicle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to note that while
the Buddhists of Northern countries are supposed to
be disciples of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na or Great Way of
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
Salvation, the Buddhism of each Northern country differs
greatly from that of the other, and that the countries
nearest to India have still further complicated the
Mah&#257;-y&#257;na system by adopting mystical doctrines, and
introducing magic and other practices supposed to aid
in the acquisition of supernatural powers.</p>
<p>It must also be borne in mind that, although the
Mah&#257;-y&#257;na or Great Method originated on the Indus,
and the H&#299;na-y&#257;na or Little Method, on the Ganges, the
two streams of teaching were not always confined to
these two areas, even on Indian soil.</p>
<p>In point of fact they were often intermixed, and
the changes thus brought about in Buddhism will
become more evident by referring to the narratives
of three well-known Buddhist travellers from China.</p>
<p>Buddhism was introduced into China between 58 and
75 of our era<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a>, but it was not till much later that Chinese
pilgrims visited India&mdash;the holy land of Buddhism.</p>
<p>The first traveller of whom we have any record was
a certain Chinese Buddhist monk named F&#257;-hien, who
set out on a pilgrimage to India about the year 399 of
our era, with the definite object of searching for and
carrying back to China complete copies of the Vinaya
or Rules of discipline for the Order. He wrote a very
simple and straightforward account of his travels<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a>&mdash;which
lasted for fourteen years&mdash;and of his visits to all
the spots in India held most sacred by Buddhists. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
was followed by a Chinese traveller of less mark, named
Sang Yun, who started about 518 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, and seems to
have ended his journey at Peshawar, or at least not
to have penetrated much further South. Peshawar, we
know, was a great Buddhist centre, and there was a fine
St&#363;pa there, containing the alms-bowl of Buddha. Then
after another interval a much more celebrated Chinese
pilgrim named Hiouen Thsang<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> started for India (<span class="small">A.D.</span>
629-644). The narrative of his travels for about fifteen
years is perhaps the best known and most commonly
quoted of the three. In Chang Yueh&rsquo;s preface<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> to these
travels Hiouen Thsang is described as &lsquo;a Doctor of the
three Pi&#7789;akas, and is said to have translated 657 works
from the original Sansk&#7771;it. In all the districts through
which he journeyed he learnt the dialects and investigated
the deep secrets of religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All three travellers give information in regard to the
prevalence of Buddhism in India up to the seventh century
of our era, and the narratives of two&mdash;F&#257;-hien and
Hiouen Thsang&mdash;are invaluable for the light they
throw on the changes which Buddhism underwent in
the interval of their travels. Here and there the
pilgrims exaggerate, especially when they venture on
numerical statistics or write from hearsay; but on the
whole their accounts may be accepted, and we learn that
Hiouen Thsang found some monasteries in ruins which
were flourishing in F&#257;-hien&rsquo;s time,
and that the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
had supplanted the earlier form of Buddhism,
or rather co-existed with it in many parts of the
South as well as of the North, and was to be found
even in Ceylon<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a>.</p>
<p>And this brings us face to face with the greatest
change of all&mdash;the total dying out of Buddhism in the
place of its origin. How is it to be accounted for that
no adherents of either the greater or lesser Buddhist
systems&mdash;of either the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na or H&#299;na-y&#257;na&mdash;are to
be found in India at the present moment?</p>
<p>The problem is difficult of solution, and I can only
offer a few suggestions for its elucidation.</p>
<p>In the first place, I think it may be confidently
asserted that the disappearance of Buddhism from India
was a very gradual process, and unattended by any
serious or violent religious revolution.</p>
<p>We have already alluded to the tolerant, liberal, and
eclectic spirit which has characterized Buddhism ever
since the period of its first promulgation at Benares.</p>
<p>Such toleration of the doctrines and ideas of co-existing
systems had its advantages, especially in the early
stages of the Buddhistic movement. It certainly had
a prophylactic effect in warding off violent attacks, and
helped to promote the diffusion of Buddhism throughout
the numerous countries to which it ultimately
spread. In India itself, as we have already seen, Buddhism
was never aggressive or combative. Its motto
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
everywhere was persuasion and conciliation. Composure,
tranquillity, and absence of acrimony were stamped on
all its features. The very foundation on which it was
reared&mdash;the very establishment of a celibate monastic
Order, by means of which true knowledge was to be
propagated&mdash;had in it something altogether agreeable
to the spirit and usages of Br&#257;hmanism.</p>
<p>We have seen, too, that the Buddha took care to
show his respect for Br&#257;hmanical traditions, even while
promulgating a philosophical theory and preaching doctrines
opposed to all sacerdotalism, priestly privileges,
supernatural revelation, and Vedic ceremonial.</p>
<p>It does not, of course, follow that the great teacher,
to whom the majority of Asiatic races have for centuries
looked as their chosen example, had not the
courage of his opinions, and was not competent to fill
the r&ocirc;le of a religious reformer.</p>
<p>The real fact was that he was too wise to enter upon
any open crusade against inveterate customs and ideas.
The peculiar calm of an Indian atmosphere, though
occasionally disturbed by political storms sweeping from
distant regions, has rarely been stirred by violent religious
antagonisms. The various currents of Hind&#363; religious
life have flowed peacefully side by side, and reformers
have generally done their work quietly. As for Gautama,
there can be little doubt that his whole career was
stamped with the impress of his early surroundings, and
that he imbibed his tolerant ideas from the Br&#257;hmanism
in which he had been trained.</p>
<p>It has been usual to blame the Br&#257;hmans for their
arrogant exclusiveness, but their arrogance has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
rather shown in magnifying their own caste-privileges
and carrying them to an extravagant pitch, than in
preventing any discussion of their own dogmas, or in
resenting any dissent from them.</p>
<p>The very essence of Br&#257;hmanism was tolerance.
Every form of opinion was admissible under a system
which made every person and every object in existence
manifestations of the one Being, Brahm&#259;.</p>
<p>The only delicate ground, on which it was dangerous
for any reformer to tread, was caste. The only unpardonable
sin was infringement of caste-rules. Nor was
any one tempted to adopt the r&ocirc;le of a violent agitator,
when all were free to express any opinion they liked
without hindrance, provided they took care to abstain
from any act of interference with caste-privileges.</p>
<p>It does not appear, in short, that the preachers of
either Buddhism, or Vaish&#7751;avism, or &#7776;aivism, or &#7776;&#257;ktism,
or of any form of these sectarian systems, ever incurred
the special animosity of the Br&#257;hmans or of each other,
or ever indulged in very violent denunciations of each
other&rsquo;s religious doctrines.</p>
<p>In real truth, these systems of doctrine were all
evolved out of Br&#257;hmanism. They were, therefore, not
only tolerated by Br&#257;hmanism, but accepted as the inevitable
outcome of its own pantheistic creed.</p>
<p>No doubt each received at first a strong stamp of individuality
from its founder, marking it off from other
systems, but with the lapse of years the deeper shades
of difference grew fainter. Then it became a question
which should become merged in the other. In such
a competition between rival systems Buddhism had
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
less chance of holding its own than either Vaish&#7751;avism
or &#7776;aivism; for its root-ideas&mdash;as we have seen&mdash;were
not rooted in the eternal instincts of human nature.</p>
<p>Buddhism, in fact, could never have maintained itself
in India till the twelfth or thirteenth century of our
era, had it not gradually, and to a great extent through
interaction with Vaish&#7751;avism and &#7776;aivism, dropped its
unnatural pessimistic theory of life and its unpopular
atheistic character, and accommodated itself to those
systems.</p>
<p>But Buddhism in parting with its ultra-pessimism and
its atheistic and agnostic ideas, lost its chief elements of
individuality and its chief independent stand-point.</p>
<p>Vaish&#7751;avism, on the other hand, was quite alive to
its own interests, and had an eye to the spread of its
own doctrines. It took care to adopt all the popular
features of Buddhism. It vied with Buddhism in inculcating
universal love, toleration, liberality, benevolence,
and abstinence from injury. It preached equality,
fraternity, and even in some cases the abolition of
caste distinctions. It taught a succession of incarnations
or rather descents (Avat&#257;ra<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a>) of divine beings
upon earth (as Buddhism taught a succession of
Buddhas), and it even adopted the Buddha himself
as one of the incarnations of Vish&#7751;u.</p>
<p>This, indeed, is the best explanation of what has
happened at Pur&#299; in Orissa, where a temple once
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
dedicated to Gautama Buddha, and supposed to contain
a relic of his burnt body, was afterwards dedicated to
the Jagann&#257;th form of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a and supposed to enshrine
one of his bones, and where low-caste and high-caste
both eat together the food cooked in the house of
that popular god.</p>
<p>The same may be said of the interaction which took
place between Buddhism and &#7776;aivism; for &#7776;aivism, of
course, was quite as bent on the propagation of its own
creed as other systems were. It vied with Buddhism
in encouraging abstract meditation, and although it
had less sympathy than Vaish&#7751;avism had with that
system, it approached in some respects so closely to its
rival, that when Buddhism disappeared from India,
images of Gautama were converted into representations
of &#7776;iva seated in profound contemplation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the interaction between the three systems
proceeded to such a point that each was influenced and
modified by the other; each learnt something, or
adopted some practice from the other.</p>
<p>It was thus, too, that &#7776;&#257;ktism, i. e. the worship of
energy or force (&#7776;akti), identified with &#7776;iva&rsquo;s consort, was
imported into Buddhism; its doctrine of the self-evolution
of all things from Prak&#7771;iti having much that harmonized
with the Buddhist theory of the origin of the
Universe. Thus, too, even T&#257;ntrism in its worst forms
became intermixed with Buddhistic practice.</p>
<p>Enough, then, has been said to justify the assertion
that Buddhism was not forcibly expelled from India
by the Br&#257;hmans. It simply in the end&mdash;possibly as
late as the thirteenth century of our era&mdash;became
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
blended with the systems which surrounded it, though
the process of blending was gradual.</p>
<p>It would certainly be easy to prove from the records
of the three Chinese travellers, that Buddhism and
Br&#257;hmanism existed together in Northern and Central
India as quite distinct systems till at least the seventh
century of our era, if not always quite amicably, yet
without any violent internecine conflict. Bitter controversies
between the two rival creeds are without
doubt clearly alluded to, and F&#257;-hien in one passage
states that &lsquo;the Br&#257;hmans with their contrary doctrine
became full of hatred and envy in their hearts<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a>.&rsquo; Yet,
on the other hand, we find that at a Council held by
the great Buddhist king &#7776;il&#257;ditya (Harsha-vardhana),
whose meritorious acts are fully described by Hiouen
Thsang (ch. v), and who had his capital at Kanouj, in
the year 634 of our era<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a>, controversial points relating
to both Buddhism and Br&#257;hmanism were discussed in
a tolerant spirit, though it is said that in discussing
questions between the Northern and Southern Buddhists,
the &lsquo;Little Vehicle&rsquo; was condemned.</p>
<p>Again, the Buddhist drama called N&#257;g&#257;nanda, &lsquo;joy of
the snake world<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a>,&rsquo; throws great light on the amicable
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
relations existing between the various sectarians and
religionists in the days of king &#7776;il&#257;ditya. It is the
only Sansk&#7771;it play in which the N&#257;nd&#299; or opening
prayer invokes the power of Buddha, thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;On whom dost thou meditate, putting on a pretence
of religious abstraction, yet opening thine eyes? See,
saviour that thou art, thou dost not pity us sick
with the shafts of Love. Falsely art thou compassionate.
Who is more cruel than thou?&rdquo; May Buddha, the
conqueror, who was thus jealously addressed by the
Apsarasas (daughters) of M&#257;ra (<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>), protect you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Professor E. B. Cowell has shown in his valuable
Preface that both this play and the sister Hind&#363; play
called Ratn&#257;vali were probably put forth or at least
patronised by Harsha-vardhana (&#7776;il&#257;ditya), and that
both were probably acted at the same period, the king
being as much a Hind&#363; as a Buddhist. Hiouen Thsang
praises Harsha-vardhana for his support of Buddhism,
but in his description of the two Convocations held by
that king, states that both Buddhists and Br&#257;hmans
were equally honoured by him, and intimates that half
his subjects held one doctrine and half the other. In the
second Convocation which took place at Pray&#257;ga (now
Allah&#257;b&#257;d) eighteen kings were present and 500,000
monks and laymen. On the first day the statue of
Buddha was installed; on the second day that of the
Sun, and on the third that of &#7776;iva. Alms were distributed
to Br&#257;hmans and Buddhists alike, and even
to the Nirgranthas or Jaina naked heretics.</p>
<p>Again the well-known play called M&#257;lat&#299;-M&#257;dhava
(by Bhava-bh&#363;ti, who lived at Kanauj in the beginning
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
of the eighth century) has an opening prayer addressed
to &#7776;iva, and yet a female Buddhist ascetic and her
attendant constitute two of the principal dramatis person&aelig;,
proving that an intermixture of the two creeds
prevailed everywhere.</p>
<p>It was also during the reign of &#7776;il&#257;ditya that the immense
monastery at N&#257;landa near R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha formed a
seat of learning, which might suggest a comparison with
the learned monkish communities and even with the
universities of medi&aelig;val Europe<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a>. In that monastery
might be seen several thousand novices and monks of
the eighteen Buddhist schools&mdash;all of them supported
by royal grants, and thus enabled both to perform their
religious duties, and to prosecute the study of philosophy,
law, and science in literary ease. It is probable
that if disputes and disagreements upon burning
questions occurred, they rarely led to serious conflicts,
and were not general throughout India, but confined
to particular localities; and I think it may be safely
affirmed that if Buddhism was ever anywhere persecuted,
it never anywhere persecuted in return.</p>
<p>I myself was much struck in a visit I paid to Ellora
in the Niz&#257;m&rsquo;s territory by the evidence I there saw
of the friendly tolerance which must have prevailed
between Br&#257;hmans, Buddhists, and Jains. Br&#257;hmanical,
Buddhist, and Jaina caves are there seen side
by side, and their inmates no doubt lived on terms
of fairly friendly tolerance, much as the members
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Wesleyan communions
live in Europe at the present day.</p>
<p>Even at Benares, the stronghold of Br&#257;hmanism, I
witnessed similar proofs of amicable mutual intercourse,
and at N&#257;sik&mdash;the Benares of Western India&mdash;the
proximity of the Buddhist caves and ruined monasteries
which I visited, made it abundantly clear that Br&#257;hmans
and Buddhists agreed to differ and to avoid
serious quarrels.</p>
<p>It must nevertheless be admitted, that in the extreme
South of India, and perhaps eventually at Benares and
a few other strongholds of Br&#257;hmanism, the difference
between the systems became so accentuated as to lead
to grievous conflicts. Whether blood was shed it is
impossible to prove; but it is alleged, with some degree
of probability, that violent crusades against Buddhism
were instituted by Kum&#257;rila and &#7776;a&#7749;kara&mdash;two well-known
Southern Br&#257;hmans noted for their bigotry&mdash;in
the seventh and eighth centuries of our era. It does
not appear, however, that they were very successful
either in the conversion or extermination of Buddhists.</p>
<p>It may, I think, be confidently affirmed that what
ultimately happened in most parts of India was, that
Vaish&#7751;avas and &#7776;aivas crept up softly to their rival
and drew the vitality out of its body by close and
friendly embraces, and that instead of the Buddhists
being expelled from India, Buddhism gradually and
quietly lost itself in Vaish&#7751;avism and &#7776;aivism. In
fact, by the beginning of the thirteenth century very
little Buddhism remained on Indian soil. In a philosophical
drama, called &lsquo;the Rise of the Moon of Knowledge&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
(Prabodha-&#263;androdaya), written probably about
the twelfth century, the approaching triumph of Br&#257;hmanism
over Buddhism is clearly indicated; for the
Buddhist and other heretical sects are represented as
belonging to the losing side.</p>
<p>Yet, after all, it is scarcely correct to say that Buddhism
ever wholly died away in India. Its name indeed
perished there, but its spirit survived, and its sacred
places remain to this day. Its ruined temples, monasteries,
monuments, and idols are scattered everywhere,
while some of these have been perpetuated and
adopted by those later phases of Hind&#363;ism which its
own toleration helped to bring into existence.</p>
<p>At all events it may be safely affirmed that the passing
away of the Buddhistic system in India was on the
whole like the peaceful passing away of a moribund
man surrounded by his relatives, and was at least unattended
with any agonizing pangs<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<h2 id="c13">LECTURE VIII.
<br /><i>Rise of Theistic and Polytheistic Buddhism.</i></h2>
<p>In the preceding Lecture we have endeavoured to
show generally how Buddhism was evolved out of
Br&#257;hmanism, how it flourished side by side with Br&#257;hmanism,
and how after a chequered career and protracted
senility in the land of its birth&mdash;lasting for at least
fifteen centuries<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a>&mdash;it ultimately merged its individuality
in Vaish&#7751;avism and &#7776;aivism, or, in other words,
disappeared and became lost in a composite system
called Hind&#363;ism.</p>
<p>We have now to trace more closely the gradual
sliding of a simple agnostic and atheistic creed, into
a variety of theistic and polytheistic conceptions.</p>
<p>We have already seen how the expansion of the H&#299;na-y&#257;na
into the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na became an inevitable result of
the Buddha&rsquo;s own teaching&mdash;in other words, how a rebound
from atheism to theism was as unavoidable as the
return swing of a heavy pendulum. We need only repeat
here that it could not have been otherwise, when a
teacher, who never claimed to be more than a man,
attempted to indoctrinate his human followers with
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
principles opposed to the inextinguishable instincts and
eternal intuitions of humanity.</p>
<p>In fact the teachers of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na school were not
slow to perceive that, if Buddhism was to gain any hold
over the masses, it was essential that it should adapt
itself to their human needs. It became imperatively
necessary, as a simple preservative measure, to convert
a cold philosophical creed, based on an ultra-pessimistic
theory of existence, into some sort of belief in
the value of human life as worth living. And if life
was not to be an invariable current of misery it followed
that there must also be some sort of faith in a superintending
God controlling that life, and interesting
Himself in Man&rsquo;s welfare.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, having once advanced beyond definite
limits, the more progressive teachers found it impossible
to draw the line at any given point.</p>
<p>No doubt the theistic movement began by simple
saint-worship&mdash;that is, by veneration for the extinct
Buddha as for a perfect saint. This was accompanied
by homage offered to his relics and to various memorials
of his person.</p>
<p>Then mere veneration and homage led to actual
worship, and the Buddha, who from first to last made
his own perfect humanity an essential principle of his
teaching, became elevated to a pinnacle far above
humanity and converted into a veritable god.</p>
<p>Next, it is easy to see that a further development of
the theistic movement became inevitable.</p>
<p>For indeed it was only natural that in process of time
some of the more eminent of the Buddha&rsquo;s followers
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
should become almost equally revered with himself. It
was not, however, till some time after their death that
they received any homage resembling that accorded to
their Master.</p>
<p>It was then that, instead of being thought of as
extinct, according to the orthodox Buddhist doctrine,
they were continually elevated in the imagination of
their admirers to heavenly regions of beatitude.</p>
<p>Of course this constant increase of saint-worship
tended to land men by degrees in a mass of theistic and
polytheistic conceptions.</p>
<p>And polytheism could not prevail in Eastern countries
without its usual reverse side&mdash;polydemonism; and
polydemonism could not prevail without its usual
adjuncts of mysticism and magic. And all of these
again entailed idolatry, relic-worship, fetish-worship, and
various other gross superstitions.</p>
<p>Such was the natural termination of the process of
degeneration. Let us now trace it more in detail.</p>
<p>And in the first place it must not be forgotten that
Gautama himself seems to have foreseen this result.</p>
<p>He seems to have been quite aware of the ineradicable
tendency inherent in the nature of human beings,
impelling them to elevate their saints and heroes to
the position of gods. He therefore took pains to make
his beloved disciple and cousin &#256;nanda understand
that the truth embodied in the Dharma or Law which
he had taught, was all that ought to take his place
and represent him when he was gone.</p>
<p>Accordingly we learn from ancient inscriptions that
for many years afterwards the only allowable object of
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
veneration among primitive Buddhists was the Law&mdash;that
is, the precepts, rules, and ordinances propounded
by Gautama himself&mdash;many of which may have been
committed to writing in early times, though oral transmission
was at first the usual rule, as it was among
Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>In time, however, the interconnexion between Br&#257;hmanism
and Buddhism, and the tendency to group
sacred objects in triads<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a>, which showed itself very early
in Hind&#363; religious thought and mythology, seems to
have led to the idea of a corresponding triple arrangement
of venerated objects among Buddhists. Hence
three precious things&mdash;sometimes called the three jewels
(<i>tri-ratna</i>), or the &lsquo;three Holies<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a>&rsquo;&mdash;came first to be held
in honour and then actually worshipped; a kind of
personality being accorded to all three, very similar to
that supposed to belong to the three chief gods of the
Hind&#363; Pantheon.</p>
<p>This triad of personalities consisted of (1) the
Buddha himself, that is to say, Gautama Buddha, or
the Buddha of the present age of the world; (2) his
Dharma or Law, that is, the word and doctrine of the
Buddha personified, or so to speak incarnated and
manifested in a visible form after his Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a; and
(3) his Sa&#7749;gha or Order of monks, also in a manner
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
personified&mdash;that is, embodied in a kind of ideal impersonation
or collective unity of his true disciples.</p>
<p>This last word, Sa&#7749;gha, which means in Sansk&#7771;it
&lsquo;a collection&rsquo; or &lsquo;assemblage,&rsquo; is sometimes, as we have
already seen (<a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>), very unsuitably rendered by the
expression &lsquo;Buddhist Church.&rsquo; It simply denotes &lsquo;the
collective body of Buddhist monks;&rsquo; that is to say, the
entire monastic fraternity, comprising in its widest sense
the whole assemblage of monks, Arhats, Pratyeka-Buddhas,
Bodhi-sattvas, perfected Buddhas and not yet
perfected saints of all classes, whether on the earth or in
any other division of the Universe; but not including&mdash;be
it carefully borne in mind&mdash;the still vaster community
of living persons constituting the whole body
of the Buddhist laity.</p>
<p>These three, then,&mdash;the Buddha, his Law, and his
Order of Monks,&mdash;passed into the first three divine
personifications of early theistic Buddhism, commonly
known as the first Buddhist Triad.</p>
<p>Hence we find that the Khuddaka-p&#257;&#7789;ha or &lsquo;lesser
readings<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a>&rsquo; of the fifteen divisions of the Khuddaka-nik&#257;ya
(<a href="#Page_63">p. 63</a>) begins thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I put my trust in the Buddha, in the Law, in the
Order&rsquo; (repeated three times).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye beings (Bh&#363;t&#257;ni) here assembled of earth and
air, let us bow, let us bow before the Buddha, revered
by gods and men. May there be prosperity!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye beings of earth and air, let us bow before the
Law.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&lsquo;Ye beings of earth and air, let us bow before the
Order of Monks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When F&#257;-hien was on his return home and in great
peril at sea, he committed his life to the protection of
the Sa&#7749;gha, saying:&mdash;&lsquo;I have travelled far in search of
the Law, let me, by your dread and supernatural power,
return from my wanderings and reach my resting-place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And again, on ending his travels, he gratefully acknowledged
that he had been guarded in his perils by
the dread power of the &lsquo;three honoured ones&rsquo; or
&lsquo;three precious ones&rsquo; or &lsquo;three Holies&rsquo;&mdash;thus acknowledging
the personality of the Law as well as of the
Buddha himself and of the Sa&#7749;gha or collective body
of Monks<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a>.</p>
<p>But it must be borne in mind that this did not
necessarily imply any worship of images. It is certain
that for a long time even Buddha himself was not represented
visibly. This is proved by the sculptures
on the Bharhut St&#363;pa. Even in the present day the
simple expression of trust in the three revered ones
constitutes the only formula of worship current in
Ceylon. It is true that images of the Buddha are
now common in that country, and while travelling there
I saw numbers of persons offering homage and flowers
to these images. But no prayer was addressed to
them, and I noticed no visible representations of the
personified Law or Sa&#7749;gha<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Nor, when I was at the Buddhist monastery near
Darj&#299;ling, did I see any image of the Law side by side
with that of Gautama, though every book examined by
me in the temple-library began with the words:&mdash;Namo
Buddh&#257;ya, &lsquo;reverence to the Buddha;&rsquo; namo Dharm&#257;ya,
&lsquo;reverence to the Law;&rsquo; namo Sa&#7749;gh&#257;ya, &lsquo;reverence to
the Order.&rsquo; The only visible symbol of the three so-called
&lsquo;Holies&rsquo; was a long staff with three prongs,
like the Indian Tri-&#7777;&#363;la.</p>
<p>It seems clear, therefore, that while, in process of
time, images of Gautama Buddha were multiplied everywhere&mdash;and,
as we shall see, in various attitudes and
shapes&mdash;images of the personified Law and Sa&#7749;gha
were never common, and indeed rarely found, except
among Northern Buddhists. Those images of the Law
which I have examined are in the form of a man<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a>
with four arms and hands, two of which are folded in
worship, while one holds a book (or sometimes a lotus)
and the other a rosary<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, the representation of a book
alone is held to be a sufficient symbol of the Law.</p>
<p>The Sa&#7749;gha, on the other hand, is generally symbolized
by the image of a man with two arms and
hands, one of which, as in the images of Buddha, rests
on the knees and the other holds a lotus.</p>
<p>And it may be observed here that of the three
images of the Buddha, the Law, and the Order, sometimes
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
one occupies the central position and sometimes
the other. This circumstance has led scholars to speak
of what it is the fashion to term a Buddhist trinity;
but in real fact neither Buddhism nor Br&#257;hmanism has
any trinity in the true meaning of the term, for although
Buddhists claim a kind of tri-unity for their
triad, and say that the first contains the second, and
that the third proceeds from the first two and contains
them, yet the first is clearly never regarded as either
the Father or Creator of the world, in the Christian sense.</p>
<p>It appears, in fact, that the earliest Buddhist worship
was exactly what might have been expected to follow
on the death of a religious Reformer and author of
a new system. It was merely the natural expression
of deep reverence for the founder of Buddhism, his
doctrine, and the collective body of his disciples.</p>
<p>So simple a form of worship, however, did not long
satisfy the devotional aspirations of the Buddha&rsquo;s
followers, even in the sacred land of pure Buddhism.</p>
<p>The mere offering of homage, either to a system of
Law, or to a community of living monks or to departed
human saints&mdash;even though their memory was kept
alive by visible representations, and stimulated by
meditation and repetition of prayer-formularies&mdash;had
in it nothing calculated to support or comfort men in
seasons of sickness, bereavement, or calamity. This
kind of simple Buddhism might have satisfied the
needs of men in times of peace and prosperity. Under
other conditions it broke down. It could offer no
shelter and give no help amid the storms and tempests
of life. Hence the development of the later phases of
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na system, the chief feature of which was
a marked change in the meaning attached to the term
&lsquo;Bodhi-sattva.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This change will be better understood if we go back
to what has already been mentioned (at <a href="#Page_98">p. 98</a>). We
have before explained that, according to the original
theory of Buddhism, a Bodhi-sattva is one who has
knowledge (derived from self-enlightening intellect) for
his essence; that is, he is a being who through all his
bodily existences is destined in some final existence to
become a Buddha, or self-enlightened man. Until his
final birth, however, a Bodhi-sattva is a being in whom
true knowledge is rather latent and undeveloped than
perfected. Gautama had been a Bodhi-sattva of this
character (see <a href="#Page_134">p. 134</a>), the merit of whose actions
(Karma) in each of his countless previous existences
(see <a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>) had been transmitted to succeeding corporeal
forms, till in the state immediately preceding
his last birth on earth he existed as a Bodhi-sattva
in the Tushita heaven (see <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>). There he continued
until the time came for him to be born on earth
as the Buddha of the present age, when he entered
the right side of his mother in the form of a white
elephant (<a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>)<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>And it may be repeated here that the white elephant,
as something rare and beautiful of its kind, was simply
symbolical of the perfect Arhatship which he was
destined to achieve in the ensuing birth.</p>
<p>Born, then, at last as the child Gautama, son of
&#7776;uddhodana, and purified by a long observance of the six
transcendent virtues (<a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>), he ultimately attained to
perfect knowledge and Arhatship under the Bodhi-tree,
and in so attaining passed from the condition of a Bodhi-sattva
to that of the highest of all Arhats&mdash;a supreme
Buddha. Then, after about forty-five years of diligent
discharge of his self-imposed task as a teacher of
the right way of salvation, he ultimately passed away
in Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a, or absolute non-existence.</p>
<p>It is important, however, to remember, that at the
moment of his attaining Buddhahood he had transferred
the Bodhi-sattvaship to Maitreya, &lsquo;the loving
and compassionate one,&rsquo; who became the Buddha-elect,
dwelling and presiding as his predecessor had done in
the heaven of contented beings (Tushita; see <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>).
There he watches over and promotes the interests of
the Buddhist faith, while awaiting the time when he
is to appear on earth as Maitreya, or the fifth Buddha
of the present age. His advent will not take place till
the lapse of five thousand years after the Nirv&#257;&#7751;a of
Gautama, when the world will have become so corrupt
that the Buddhist Law will be no more obeyed, nor
even remembered.</p>
<p>No wonder then that this Maitreya&mdash;whose very
name implies love and tenderness towards mankind,
and who was destined to become, like Gautama, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
Saviour of the world by teaching its inhabitants how to
save themselves&mdash;became a favourite object of personal
worship after Gautama Buddha&rsquo;s death. Even when
the worship of other Bodhi-sattvas was introduced,
Maitreya retained the distinction of being the only
Bodhi-sattva worshipped by all Buddhist countries,
whether in the South or in the North. Not that
Gautama&rsquo;s memory was neglected. He was, of course,
held to be superior to Maitreya, who was still a mere
Bodhi-sattva or Buddha-designate. But the feeling
towards Gautama Buddha, after his Nirv&#257;&#7751;a and death,
became different, and the object of bringing flowers
and offerings to his shrines was simply to honour the
memory of a departed, not an existing saint. It was
a mere mechanical act, fraught with beneficial consequences,
but not supplying any real religious need.
On the other hand actual prayers were addressed to
Maitreya, as to a living merciful being, whose favour it
was all-important to secure, and whose heaven was
believed to be a region of perfect love and contentment,
to which all his worshippers were admitted.</p>
<p>In Hiouen Thsang&rsquo;s Travels a heavenly &#7770;ishi is
represented as saying:&mdash;&lsquo;No words can describe the
personal beauty of Maitreya. He declares a law not
different from ours. His exquisite voice is soft and
pure. Those who hear it can never tire; those who
listen are never satiated<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In fact, the aspirations of few pious Buddhists in
early times ever led them to soar higher than the
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
happiness of living with Maitreya and listening to his
voice in his own Tushita heaven.</p>
<p>It is true that afterwards when the worship of the
Dhy&#257;ni-Buddha Amit&#257;bha came into vogue in Northern
countries this Buddha&rsquo;s heaven, called Sukh&#257;vat&#299;,
fabled to be somewhere in the Western sky, seems to
have taken the place of the heaven of Maitreya. But
this belongs to a later phase of Buddhism, to be explained
when we speak of the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas (<a href="#Page_203">p. 203</a>).</p>
<p>It was for Maitreya&rsquo;s Tushita heaven that Hiouen
Thsang, and other devout men of his day, prayed on
their death-beds, and the one Chinese inscription found
at Buddha-Gay&#257; is full of expressions indicative of the
same longing<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a>.</p>
<p>If then, we are able to enter into the feelings of
Buddhists everywhere in depending on the living,
loving, and energizing Maitreya, rather than on the
extinct Buddha who existed only in their memories, we
shall find it less difficult to understand how it came to
pass that the idea of, so to speak, canonizing every great
saint or popular head of a monastic community, and
elevating him at death to the position of a Bodhi-sattva
like Maitreya, living in permanent regions of
bliss, and able to help his votaries to the same position,
came into vogue.</p>
<p>It may make the course of development of Theistic
Buddhism clearer if we here revert to the early
constitution of the Buddhist monastic brotherhood, and
endeavour to show how the homage paid to eminent
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
and saint-like men led, first to the multiplication of
Bodhi-sattvas, and then to polytheism and every form
of polytheistic superstition.</p>
<p>A full explanation of the early monastic system is
given in the learned work of Koeppen<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a>. It is clear
that as long as Gautama was alive he was the sole
Head of the brotherhood of monks. After his death
the Headship (as in the Christian brotherhood after the
death of Christ) was not assigned to any one leader.
The Buddha himself forbade this. The term Sa&#7751;gha
at that time merely denoted a republican fraternity of
monks, bound by no irrevocable vows and subject to no
hierarchical Superior, but all intent on following the
example, and propagating the doctrines of their departed
leader. Soon, however, the formation of separate centres
of union and teaching became inevitable, and the term
Sa&#7751;gha was then applied to each separate society, and
sometimes even to a separate Conclave of each society,
as well as to the whole body. It seems at least
certain that each monastic association had the right to
admit monks, to hear confession, and to excommunicate.
Naturally, too, in course of time it became necessary
for each society to have some sort of governing body
and choose a kind of president, and this presiding
officer was originally the senior monk, and accordingly
had the simple title of Sthavira (Thera), &lsquo;Elder.&rsquo; This
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
title appears to have been introduced immediately after
Gautama&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>It is believed that ever since the time of the great
A&#7777;oka, Sthaviras or Elders who became actual superintendents
of monasteries, exercised administrative
powers, like those of Abbots; each over his own monastic
community. This was the first kind of Headship recognized.
It was simply a superiority of age.</p>
<p>As to any still higher form of authority corresponding
to that of Pope, Archbishop, or Bishop, and extending
over several monasteries, this did not belong to
early Buddhism or to its earliest developments. Lists
of uninterrupted series of pretended Buddhist Hierarchs
exist, but are mere fanciful fabrications. Nevertheless,
it is certainly a historical fact that along with
the superiority of mere age, seniority, and experience,
there rapidly grew up <i>pari passu</i> a superiority of knowledge,
learning, and sanctity, which were generally,
though not invariably, combined in the person of the
presiding Elder.</p>
<p>Any one, in fact, who was distinguished for the
practice of the highest degree of meditation, for complete
acquaintance with the Law, for special purity of
conduct, and perfect fulfilment of the precepts, was
naturally elevated above the class of ordinary Bhikshus.
Such a monk was from the earliest times dignified by
the title Arhat, &lsquo;very reverend,&rsquo; i. e. more worthy of
honour than the generality. Arhat, in short, was from
the first a name for the higher grade of saint-like
Bhikshu. Such a man, too, before long, was raised to
a still higher level in the estimation of his fellow-monks.
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
He was believed to have delivered himself from all the
consequences of acts, whether bad or good&mdash;from all the
fetters (see <a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>) of life, and therefore from all re-birth.
He was even elevated to a still loftier pinnacle. He
was believed by his superstitious admirers to possess
unlimited dominion over nature, space, time, and matter;
to be all-seeing, all-powerful, and capable of working
every kind of miracle. Then, of course, at death he
passed away in Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a and was, so to speak,
canonized. Be it noted, however, that such canonization
was never accorded to an Arhat till after his departure
from the world.</p>
<p>Probably the immediate disciples of Gautama Buddha&mdash;that
is, his so-called &lsquo;great pupils&rsquo; (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>),
were all considered perfect Arhats. And these perfect
Arhats were probably the only saints of the earliest
period of Buddhism. Yet there was one who surpassed
them all by an immeasurable interval, and that one was
Gautama Buddha himself. It was the distinguishing
mark of a supreme Buddha that he was infinitely
greater than all other Arhats, because he had not only
gained perfect knowledge himself, but had become the
Saviour of the whole world by imparting to men the
knowledge of how they were to save themselves.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, only natural that the followers of
Buddha, and probably the Buddha himself, before his
decease, should have thought it desirable to establish
a more systematic gradation of saintship by filling up
the immense gap between ordinary Arhats and the
supreme Buddha. It was this that led to the idea
of Pratyeka-Buddhas, that is, self-dependent solitary
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
Buddhas<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> (see <a href="#Page_134">p. 134</a>), as well as to the notion of a still
higher being called a Bodhi-sattva, who, as the Buddha-designate
and future successor of Gautama, occupied a
still more exalted intermediate position than a Pratyeka-Buddha.</p>
<p>Of course it became difficult to fix on any living
man, or any recently deceased saint worthy of the
highest stage of Bodhi, to which a being about to
become a perfect Buddha was supposed to attain.</p>
<p>The first to be so elevated (though apparently not by
Gautama himself) was, as frequently mentioned before,
the mythical individual Maitreya. He was, we repeat,
for a long time the only Bodhi-sattva recognized by
all Buddhists alike, whether adherents of the H&#299;na-y&#257;na
or Mah&#257;-y&#257;na. But he was not a historical personage,
like Gautama or his immediate disciples. He was a
mere mythological personification of that spirit of love&mdash;of
that kindly and friendly disposition towards all
living beings by force of which Buddhism hoped one
day to conquer the world, and win it over to itself.</p>
<p>And in conformity with his mythical character, and
probably to prevent the rivalry of pretenders among
future ambitious heads of monasteries, he was not to
appear for five thousand years, till the teaching of
Gautama had lost its power.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was only to be expected that this rank
should at first have been accorded to one person alone&mdash;just
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
as in worldly affairs there could be only one
Heir-apparent to the throne.</p>
<p>Such was the more simple doctrine of early Buddhism
in regard to the relative position of the members of the
Buddhist community.</p>
<p>How then did the teachers of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na proceed
to amplify this doctrine?</p>
<p>They taught that there were two methods of salvation
or, so to speak, two ways or two vehicles&mdash;the Great and
the Little (Mah&#257;-y&#257;na and H&#299;na-y&#257;na)&mdash;and indeed two
Bodhis or forms of true knowledge which these vehicles
had to convey<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a>. The former was for ordinary persons,
the latter for beings of larger talents and higher spiritual
powers. The &lsquo;Little Way&rsquo; was the simple doctrine,
which had many Arhats but only one Bodhi-sattva;
the &lsquo;Great Way,&rsquo; on the other hand, was the wider and
broader, which had many Bodhi-sattvas as well as many
Arhats. He who satisfied the usual requirements of
Saintship received the rank of an Arhat in both systems.
But in the wider system every one who aimed at unusual
sanctity on the one hand, and knowledge (Bodhi)
on the other, might walk on the Great road leading to
Bodhi-sattvaship, and receive the title Bodhi-sattva.</p>
<p>We have seen (<a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a>) that the H&#299;na-y&#257;na, or &lsquo;Little
system,&rsquo; taught that there were only twenty-four
Buddhas who had preceded Gautama. Three of these
(viz. Kraku-&#263;&#263;handa, Kanaka-muni, and K&#257;&#7777;yapa), with
Gautama as a fourth, had appeared in the present age,
and only one Bodhi-sattva (Maitreya) was to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>But according to the &lsquo;Great System,&rsquo; it was a mistake
to limit the acquisition of the highest Saintship
in this manner. It maintained that there would be
numberless supreme Buddhas (and, in addition to them,
self-taught, solitary Buddhas, called Pratyeka-Buddhas),
as well as numberless Bodhi-sattvas, even in the present
age of the world. In other words, it propounded the
doctrine that the practice of the six (or ten) transcendent
virtues (<a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>), and especially the acquisition of transcendent
wisdom (praj&ntilde;&#257; p&#257;ramit&#257;), might qualify many
saints for the attainment of Bodhi-sattvaship and
Buddhaship. According to one theory, there were to
be at least a thousand Bodhi-sattvas, followed by a
thousand Buddhas, while, according to others, Buddhas
and Bodhi-sattvas were to be reckoned by myriads.</p>
<p>But this theory of numberless Bodhi-sattvas involved
an entirely new view of their nature and of the meaning
of the term.</p>
<p>In fact, the Bodhi-sattvas of the more developed
Mah&#257;-y&#257;na school were not Bodhi-sattvas at all, according
to the strict sense of the term. It is true they
resembled the genuine Bodhi-sattva in having gone
through a long series of existences leading them at last
to perfect saintship and to a heaven of their own, but
they were under no obligation to give up their
Bodhi-sattvaship, quit their celestial abodes, or descend
ultimately as human Buddhas upon earth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they never appeared to aim at Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a
like their earthly counterparts. Their most obvious
<i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> seems to have been to supply the need of
personal objects of worship, and though in Tibet they
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
were believed to have their own secondary corporeal
emanations&mdash;sometimes called their &lsquo;incarnations,&rsquo; but
more properly described as descents (avat&#257;ra) of portions
of their essence in a constant succession of human saints,&mdash;they
never really left their own permanent stations in
the heavenly regions. Indeed, it is probable that the chief
cause of their popularity, as personal objects of adoration,
was that they were able to help their worshippers
to attain to the same permanent and unchangeable
regions of bliss.</p>
<p>It was thus that the &lsquo;Great Vehicle&rsquo; took up an
attitude which raised it not only above the simple effort
to suppress the passions and desires, but also above the
hopeless Nihilism of early Buddhism; for it soon became
the fashion for the most devoted and pious of Buddhist
monks to aspire to the title and actual blessedness of
Bodhi-sattvaship rather than to the doubtful blessedness
of utter personal annihilation involved in Buddhahood.
At any rate the numerous Bodhi-sattvas
of the &lsquo;Great Method&rsquo; appear to have remained quite
contented with their condition, so long as it involved
perpetual residence in the heavens, and quite willing to
put off all desire for Buddhahood and Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a.</p>
<p>Without doubt, this more amplified system was the
result of a reaction of Br&#257;hmanism on Buddhism. It
was at first a mere plan for creating a close Hierarchy
like that of the Br&#257;hman caste&mdash;that is to say, a privileged
class of men possessed of higher knowledge and
sanctity and superior to the majority of Bhikshus of the
common stamp. Then it soon developed into a scheme
for satisfying the craving of the masses for divinities of
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
some kind to whom they might appeal for help in time
of need.</p>
<p>In all probability the first to receive the title of
Bodhi-sattva, next to Maitreya, were the most celebrated
Arhats before mentioned, who were immediate
disciples of Gautama, not however till death had separated
them from their human frames, when, as a matter
of course, they received a kind of worship like that
accorded to all leaders of men, just as the earliest saints,
heroes, and teachers of Br&#257;hmanism did.</p>
<p>To specify all the Arhats who were elevated to the
rank of Bodhi-sattva and became objects of veneration
in later times would be a difficult and unprofitable task.</p>
<p>We may also dismiss, as unworthy of note, statements
such as that in the Lalita-vistara, in which it is declared
that 32,000 Bodhi-sattvas joined the Buddha&rsquo;s assembly
in the Jetavana garden. But we may notice the quasi-deification
of a few historical personages mentioned by
the two Chinese travellers, whose account of the state
of Buddhism in India from the fourth to the seventh
centuries has been so often quoted.</p>
<p>First of all came the immediate followers and so-called
&lsquo;great pupils&rsquo; (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>) of Gautama, namely, his
two chief disciples, &#7776;&#257;ri-puttra and Moggall&#257;na (Maudgaly&#257;yana
= Modgala-puttra)<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a>, both of whom are believed
to have died before him. Then came the three
great leaders at the first Council: 1. K&#257;&#7777;yapa (pp. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>, <a href="#Page_55">55</a>);
2. Gautama&rsquo;s cousin and beloved pupil &#256;nanda;
3. Up&#257;li (<a href="#fn_23">note, p. 56</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Next to these perhaps the most celebrated teacher
elevated to Bodhi-sattvaship was N&#257;g&#257;rjuna<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a>&mdash;noticed
before as the alleged founder of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na system
and its introducer into Tibet. According to one account
he was the son of a Br&#257;hman of Vidarbha, and taught
Buddhism in the south of India. He had a celebrated
disciple named Deva (or &#256;rya-deva)<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a>. N&#257;g&#257;rjuna was
at any rate a great teacher and developer of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na.
A legend relates that he was skilled in magic,
and was able thereby to prolong his own and a Southern
Indian king&rsquo;s life indefinitely. This caused great grief
to the mother of the Heir-apparent, who instigated her
son to ask N&#257;g&#257;rjuna for his own head. N&#257;g&#257;rjuna
complied with the request, and cut his own head off with
a blade of Ku&#7777;a grass, nothing else having the power to
injure him. He is said by Hiouen Thsang to have lived
in Southern Ko&#7777;ala about 400 years after the death of
Gautama, and is worshipped under different epithets in
Tibet, China, Mongolia, and even Ceylon. Probably he
lived in the first or second century&mdash;Beal places him
between <span class="small">A.D.</span> 166 and 200. Wassiljew considers him a
wholly mythical personage. The additions he made to
Buddhist doctrines were undoubtedly great. When
he died St&#363;pas were erected to his memory, and in some
places he was even worshipped as Buddha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Among other deified, or partially deified Bodhi-sattvas,
whose images and St&#363;pas (<a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>) the Chinese
pilgrims found scattered in various parts of India, may
be mentioned, those of the mythical Buddhas who
preceded Gautama, especially K&#257;&#7777;yapa<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a>. Then we have
R&#257;hula (son of Gautama), the patron of all novices, and
founder of the realistic school called Vaibh&#257;shika<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a>;
Dharma-p&#257;la, Vasu-mitra (or Vasu-bandhu), A&#7777;va-ghosha,
Gu&#7751;amati, Sthiramati, and others. In this
practice of deifying their saints, Buddhists merely
followed the example of the adherents of Hind&#363;ism.
And we may add that this tendency is constantly repeating
itself in the religious history of all nations.</p>
<p>There is even a tendency to press the saints of other
countries into the service. This is remarkably exemplified
in the history of Barlaam and Josaphat, current in Europe
in the Middle Ages. The zealous Roman Catholics of
those days thought that they could not exclude so noble
a monk as Buddha from the catalogue of their own
saints, and so they registered him in their list as St.
Josaphat (Josaphat being a corruption of Bodhisat).
Colonel Yule, in his Marco Polo, states that a church in
Palermo is dedicated to this saint.</p>
<p>And here mention may be made of a modern deified
Hind&#363; teacher or sage, named Gorakh-n&#257;th, who is said
to have gone from India into Nep&#257;l, and is worshipped
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
there as well as at Gorakh-pur and throughout the
Panj&#257;b. Very little is known about him, and he
belongs more to Hind&#363;ism than to Buddhism. Some
say that he was a contemporary of Kab&#299;r (1488-1512),
and, according to a Janams&#257;kh&#299;, he once had an interview
with N&#257;nak, the founder of the Sikh sect. Such
legendary accounts as are current are wrapped in much
mystery. One legend describes him as born from a lotus.</p>
<p>Others describe him as the third or fourth in a series
of &#7776;aiva teachers, and the founder of the K&#257;nph&#257;&#7789;&#257;
sect of Yog&#299;s. The remarkable thing about him is that
he succeeded in achieving an extraordinary degree of
popularity among Northern Hind&#363;s and among some
adherents of Buddhism in Nep&#257;l. His tomb is in the
Panj&#257;b, and he is to this day adored as a kind of god
by immense numbers of the inhabitants of North
Western India under the hills.</p>
<p>But the canonization of such historical teachers in
India and their elevation to semi-divine rank did not
satisfy the craving of the uneducated masses, either
among Buddhists or Hind&#363;s, for personal deities, possessed
of powers over human affairs far greater than
any departed human beings, however eminent. In
Buddhism the supposed existence of the more god-like
Bodhi-sattva Maitreya&mdash;venerated by both the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na
and the H&#299;na-y&#257;na schools&mdash;was not sufficient to
satisfy this craving.</p>
<p>Hence the &lsquo;Great Vehicle&rsquo; soon began to teach the
existence of numerous mythological Bodhi-sattvas,
other than Maitreya, to whom no historical character
belonged, but whose functions were more divine.</p>

<h2 id="c14">LECTURE IX.
<br /><i>Theistic and Polytheistic Buddhism.</i></h2>
<p>In the preceding Lecture I have endeavoured to
sketch the rise of theistic and polytheistic Buddhism.</p>
<p>We have now to turn our attention to its development,
especially in regard to the worship of mythical
Bodhi-sattvas, and of the Hind&#363; gods and other mythological
beings.</p>
<p>Some of the Bodhi-sattvas of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na or Great
System were merely quasi-deifications of eminent saints
and teachers. Others were impersonations of certain
qualities or forces; and just as in early Buddhism
we have the simple triad of the Buddha, his Law,
and his Order, so in Northern Buddhism the worship
of mythical Bodhi-sattvas&mdash;other than Maitreya&mdash;was
originally confined to a triad, namely (1) Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;,
&lsquo;he of beautiful glory;&rsquo; (2) Avalokite&#7777;vara, &lsquo;the looking-down
lord,&rsquo; often called Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i, &lsquo;the lotus-handed;&rsquo;
(3) Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i or Vajra-dhara, &lsquo;the thunderbolt-handed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These three mythical Bodhi-sattvas were not known
to early Buddhists, nor to the Buddhists of Ceylon.
They are not even found in the oldest books of the
Northern School (such as the Lalita-vistara), though
they occur conspicuously in the Saddharma-pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka.</p>
<p>All we can say with certainty is, that when F&#257;-hien
visited Mathur&#257; on the Jumn&#257; 400 years after Christ,
their cult certainly existed there at that time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>We shall not be far wrong if we assert that it
was adopted in about the third century of our era.</p>
<p>As already indicated (see <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>), the idea of the first
Buddhist triad&mdash;the Buddha, the Law, and the Monastic
Order&mdash;accepted by the adherents of both Vehicles&mdash;was
probably derived from the earliest Br&#257;hmanical
triad. (See also Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism, pp. 9, 44. 74.)</p>
<p>In the same way the second Buddhist triad introduced
by the advanced teachers of the &lsquo;Great Vehicle,&rsquo;
viz. Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;, Avalokite&#7777;vara (= Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i), and
Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i, corresponded to the later Hind&#363; triad
(tri-m&#363;rti) of deities, Brahm&#257;, Vish&#7751;u, and &#7776;iva.</p>
<p>I have explained in &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism&rsquo;
(pp. 54, 73) how the gods Vish&#7751;u and &#7776;iva gradually
usurped the position of the god Brahm&#257;, whom they
dispossessed of his co-equality with themselves, and
how the whole mythology of the Hind&#363;s, which was
originally complicated by a large admixture of pre-&#256;ryan
and Vedic elements, ultimately became more
simplified by arranging itself under the two heads of
Vaish&#7751;avism and &#7776;aivism, all other mythological personages
being regarded as forms of either Vish&#7751;u or &#7776;iva.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to this, we find that each member
of the two Buddhist triads holds its own, and we are
led on to a system which bewilders us by ever increasing
complications&mdash;a system which preserves the
individuality of its own triads and deified saints, and
yet recognizes almost all the gods, demigods, demons,
and supernatural beings of Hind&#363;ism.</p>
<p>I propose now to offer some account of the development
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
of the Buddhist Pantheon, beginning with the
mythical conceptions peculiar to Buddhism, and passing
on to those held in common with Hind&#363;ism.</p>
<p>And first as to the second Buddhist triad above-named,
it may be noted, as a proof of the very gradual
growth of Buddhistic mythology, that in the earlier
developments of Buddhism the three Bodhi-sattvas
constituting that triad have very restricted functions.</p>
<p>When I visited the Buddhist caves at Ellora, I
noticed that in the ancient sculptures there, Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i
and Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i (but not Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;) are represented
as attendants of the human Buddha.</p>
<p>Of course it is easy to understand that the duty of
guarding the Buddha ultimately expanded into that of
watching over and protecting the whole Buddhist world,
though it is difficult to determine which of the three
mythical Bodhi-sattvas became first celebrated for the
effective discharge of this duty, or to which of the three
chronological precedence ought to be assigned.</p>
<p>Without taking the order already given, we may
begin with Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i as the most popular, and may
note that he has a name, Avalokite&#7777;vara, composed of
the two Sansk&#7771;it words avalokita, &lsquo;looking down<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a>,&rsquo;
and &#298;&#7777;vara, &lsquo;lord,&rsquo; the latter being the Br&#257;hmanical
name for the Supreme God&mdash;a name wholly unrecognized
by early Buddhism, but assigned by the Hind&#363;s
to the three personal gods, Brahm&#257;, Vish&#7751;u, and &#7776;iva,
especially to the latter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>In the duty of watching over and protecting the
whole Buddhist world, Avalokite&#7777;vara (= Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i),
that is, &lsquo;the lord who looks down with pity on all men,&rsquo;
certainly takes the lead, and his name was in keeping
with the reputation for answering prayer which he
soon achieved.</p>
<p>In the L&#257;mism of Tibet, he is, as we shall see hereafter,
a kind of divine Pope, existing eternally in the
heavens as Vicar of one of the Buddhas of the present
age, but delegating his functions to a succession of
earthly Popes in whom he is perpetually incarnated
and re-incarnated, while at the same time preserving
his own personality in his own heaven.</p>
<p>Indeed, the popularity of his worship is one of the
chief characteristics of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na system, and is
not confined to Tibet, though he is believed to be the
special patron of that country. It is he who during
the continuance of the present age of the world presides
over the whole cycle of soul-migration. In a word, the
temporal welfare of all living beings, and of all who
have to wander through the worlds of the gods, men,
demons, ghosts, animals, and livers in hell, is especially
assigned to him.</p>
<p>People, therefore, pray to him more frequently than
to any other Bodhi-sattva, and not only for release
from the misery of future re-births, but in all cases of
present bodily danger and domestic affliction. Hence
he has numerous other names or epithets, such as &lsquo;God
of mercy,&rsquo; &lsquo;Ocean of pity&rsquo; (Karu&#7751;&#257;r&#7751;ava), &lsquo;Deliverer
from fear&rsquo; (Abhaya&#7747;-da), &lsquo;Lord of the world&rsquo; (Loke&#7777;-vara),
&lsquo;World-protector&rsquo; (Loka-p&#257;la), &lsquo;Protector of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
&#256;ryas&rsquo; (&#256;rya-p&#257;la); and the Chinese traveller F&#257;-hien
says of himself, that he prayed in his heart for the aid
of Avalokite&#7777;vara when in great peril during a storm
at sea.</p>
<p>That his worship was very prevalent among Buddhists
of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na School all over India, as well as in
Tibet, from the fourth to the seventh century, is attested
also by Hiouen Thsang. Both travellers tell us that
they frequently met with his images, which were often
placed on the tops of mountains. Possibly this fact
may account for the name he acquired of the &lsquo;Looking-down
lord.&rsquo; Or, on the other hand, it is possible that
his name may have led to the selection of high situations
for his temples and images.</p>
<p>And it may be observed here that although Avalokite&#7777;vara
bears a close resemblance in character to
Vish&#7751;u, yet his images often conform to the Brahm&#257;
type, and sometimes to that of &#7776;iva<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a>. He has generally
several faces&mdash;sometimes even eleven or twelve&mdash;and
usually four or eight arms. These faces are placed one
above the other in the form of a pyramid, in three
tiers, and probably indicate that he looks down on all
three worlds, namely, the worlds of desire, of true form,
and of no form (pp. <a href="#Page_213">213</a>, <a href="#Page_214">214</a>), from all points of the
horizon.</p>
<p>Note, however, that two of his hands are generally
folded, as if adoring the Buddha, while his two other
hands hold such emblems as the lotus and wheel
(especially the lotus). This distinguishes the images
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
of the mere Bodhi-sattva Avalokite&#7777;vara from those
of the god Vish&#7751;u, who, although he has four arms,
is never represented in an attitude of adoration.
Note, too, that the many-headed images of Avalokite&#7777;vara
probably belong to the later phase of the
Mah&#257;-y&#257;na, when he was regarded as an emanation or
spiritual son of the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddha Amit&#257;bha, whose
head forms the eleventh above his own ten. There
are descriptions of earlier idols, which make it probable
that Avalokite&#7777;vara was originally represented in ordinary
human shape.</p>
<p>When his worship was introduced into China the
name he received was Kwan-she-yin or Kwan-yin (in
Japan Kwan-non)&mdash;a name denoting (according to
Professor Legge) &lsquo;one who looks down on the sounds
of the world, and listens to the voices of men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We know that each of the chief Hind&#363; gods had his
female counterpart or &#7776;akti, who is often more worshipped
than the male. Similarly the female counterpart
of the male Avalokite&#7777;vara is the form of the god
chiefly worshipped in China and Japan<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a>. In those
countries he is only known in the feminine character of
&lsquo;goddess of mercy,&rsquo; and in this form is represented with
two arms, but oftener with four or more, and even with
a thousand eyes.</p>
<p>The connexion of Avalokite&#7777;vara with &#7776;iva, as well
as with Vish&#7751;u, is proved by the fact that in some
characteristics Kwan-yin corresponds to the Durg&#257;
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
form of &#7776;iva&rsquo;s wife, and in others to the form called
P&#257;rvat&#299;, who, as dwelling on mountains, may be supposed
to look down with compassion on the world.</p>
<p>As to Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i (or Vajra-dhara), &lsquo;the thunderbolt-handed,&rsquo;
this Bodhi-sattva corresponds in some respects
to Indra. He is the fiercest and most awe-inspiring of
all the Bodhi-sattvas, and was, in time, converted into
a kind of Buddhistic form of &#7776;iva, resembling that
god in his character of controller of the demon-host
and destroyer of evil spirits. Hiouen Thsang describes
how eight Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;is surrounded the Buddha as an
escort, when he journeyed to visit his father &#7776;uddhodana.
Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i is of course a popular object of
veneration in all Northern Buddhist countries, where
a dread of malignant spirits is so prevalent that the
waving to and fro of an implement symbolizing a thunderbolt
(Vajra, or in Tibetan Dorje) is practised as a
method of keeping them at bay and averting their malice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i is not so popular as the
third Bodhi-sattva, Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;, &lsquo;he of glorious beauty,&rsquo;
also called Ma&ntilde;ju-ghosha, &lsquo;having a beautiful voice,&rsquo;
and V&#257;g&#299;&#7777;vara, &lsquo;lord of speech.&rsquo; This Bodhi-sattva,
as &lsquo;wisdom personified,&rsquo; and as &lsquo;lord of harmony,&rsquo; may
be regarded as a counterpart of the Br&#257;hmanical Brahm&#257;
or Vi&#7777;va-Karman, the supposed creator of the universe.
Brahm&#257;, however, in his character of chief god, needed no
Buddhistic substitute, having been incorporated by name
into Buddhism. Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;, as &lsquo;lord of speech,&rsquo; seems
also to be a counterpart of Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s consort Sarasvat&#299;.</p>
<p>According to some, a learned and eloquent Br&#257;hman
teacher, named Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;, introduced Buddhism from
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
India into Nep&#257;l about 250 years after the Nirv&#257;&#7751;a of
Buddha, and the mythical Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299; may have been a
development of the historical personage. His worship
is mentioned by both F&#257;-hien and Hiouen Thsang<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a>,
and seems to have been very popular.</p>
<p>A personification of Praj&ntilde;&#257; p&#257;ramit&#257;, &lsquo;transcendent
wisdom,&rsquo; is also named. And indeed it seems natural
that so soon as the Buddhists began to personify
qualities and invest them with divine attributes, learning
should have been among the first selected for
deification, as it was by the Hind&#363;s in early times.</p>
<p>Mark, however, that the popular Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299; has no
place assigned to him in the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddha theory.</p>
<p>This mystical theory was a later development. It
may be explained thus:&mdash;The term Dhy&#257;na (Jh&#257;na)
is a general expression for the four gradations of mystic
meditation which have ethereal spaces or worlds corresponding
to them (<a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>), and a Dhy&#257;ni-Buddha is
a Buddha who is supposed to exist as a kind of spiritual
essence in these higher regions of abstract thought.</p>
<p>That is to say, every Buddha who appears on earth
in a temporary human body&mdash;with the object of teaching
men how to gain Nirv&#257;&#7751;a&mdash;exists also in an ideal
counterpart, or ethereal representation of himself, in the
formless worlds of meditation (<a href="#Page_213">p. 213</a>). These ideal
Buddhas are as numerous as the Buddhas, but as there
are only five chief human Buddhas in the present age&mdash;Kraku-&#263;&#263;handa,
Kanaka-muni, K&#257;&#7777;yapa, Gautama, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
the future Buddha Maitreya&mdash;so there are only five corresponding
Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas:&mdash;Vairo&#263;ana, Akshobhya,
Ratna-sambhava, Amit&#257;bha, and Amogha-siddha (sometimes
represented in images as possessing a third eye).
But this is not all; each of these produces by a process
of evolution a kind of emanation from himself called
a Dhy&#257;ni-Bodhi-sattva, to act as the practical head and
guardian of the Buddhist community between the interval
of the death of each human Buddha and the
advent of his successor. Hence there are five Bodhi-sattvas&mdash;Samanta-bhadra,
Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i, Ratna-p&#257;&#7751;i, Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i
(= Avalokite&#7777;vara), and Vi&#7777;va-p&#257;&#7751;i&mdash;corresponding
to the five Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas and to the five
earthly Buddhas respectively. In Nep&#257;l five corresponding
female &#7776;aktis or T&#257;r&#257;-dev&#299;s are named (see <a href="#Page_216">p. 216</a>).</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the Chinese pilgrims from the
fifth to the seventh centuries, while often mentioning
the Bodhi-sattvas, make no allusion to any of the
Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas&mdash;whence we may gather that Amit&#257;bha,
though adopted into Indian Buddhism, was not
actually worshipped in India at least as a personal god.</p>
<p>In point of fact, it was only the Buddhism of the
North which was not satisfied with the original triad
of the Buddha, the Law, and the Monkhood. It,
therefore, invented in addition five triads, each consisting
of a Dhy&#257;ni-Buddha, a Dhy&#257;ni-Bodhi-sattva, and
an earthly Buddha, though of these triads only one was
of importance, namely, that consisting of Amit&#257;bha,
Avalokite&#7777;vara, and the human Buddha, Gautama. But
the Lalita-vistara does not mention this theory.</p>
<p>It should be observed, too, that an important addition
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
to the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na doctrine was made in certain
Northern countries about the tenth century of our era.</p>
<p>A particular sect of Buddhists in Nep&#257;l, calling themselves
Ai&#7777;varikas, propounded a theory of a Supreme
Being (&#298;&#7777;vara), to whom they gave the name of a &lsquo;primordial
Buddha&rsquo; (&#256;di-Buddha), and who was declared to
be the source and originator of all things, and the
original Evolver of the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas, or Buddhas
of contemplation, while they again were supposed to
evolve their corresponding Dhy&#257;ni-Bodhi-sattvas.</p>
<p>It is clear, of course, that this addition was a mere
adaptation of Buddhism to Br&#257;hmanism, and that the
&#256;di-Buddha was invented to serve as a counterpart of
the One Universal Spirit Brahm&#259;&mdash;the one eternally
existing spiritual Essence, from which all existing things
are mere emanations.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, this &#256;di-Buddha is said to have
produced all things through union with Praj&ntilde;&#257; (mentioned
before, <a href="#Page_202">p. 202</a>), in which case he is rather to be
identified with the personal Creator Brahm&#257;.</p>
<p>Observe, moreover, that even in early times one of
the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas&mdash;the one called Amit&#257;bha, &lsquo;diffusing
infinite light,&rsquo;&mdash;lost his purely abstract character,
and was worshipped by Northern Buddhists as a personal
God. He is in the present day held by them to
be an eternal Being, the ideal of all that is beautiful
and good, who receives his worshippers into a heaven
called Sukh&#257;vati, &lsquo;paradise of pleasures&rsquo; (see <a href="#Page_183">p. 183</a>).</p>
<p>But it must also be noted that neither &#256;di-Buddha
nor Amit&#257;bha, when regarded as personal gods, were
held to be Creators of the World in the Christian sense.
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
They were merely Supreme rulers outside and above
it; for Northern Buddhists agree with Southern in
thinking that the world exists of itself, and that its
only Creator is the force of its own acts.</p>
<p>We pass on now to consider how far and with what
modifications the mythology of Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism
was incorporated into Buddhism.</p>
<p>I have already pointed out that although the Buddha
changed the character of much of the existing mythology,
he never prohibited his lay-followers from continuing
their old forms of worship, or bowing down before the
deities honoured by their fathers and grandfathers.</p>
<p>Apart indeed from the shrewd policy of not assuming
an attitude of hostility to popular creeds and usages, the
tolerant tendency and universality of the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching
obliged him, in common consistency, to recognize,
and as far as possible appropriate, the various religious
elements existing around him, and to subordinate them
to his own purposes.</p>
<p>In fact, according to the theory of true Buddhism, as
has been well pointed out by other writers, there was
only one system of doctrine and only one Law&mdash;that
Law (Dharma) which Gautama Buddha came to renovate
for the benefit of the world in the present age.</p>
<p>Hence all the apparently conflicting creeds, dogmas,
forms, ceremonies, and usages of all nations, tribes, and
races, were in reality mere outcomes, or dim recollections,
or corruptions, of that one and the same universal
Dharma which countless Buddhas had preached to mankind,
in countless ages before the time of Gautama, and
would continue to preach in ages to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Hind&#363;ism, therefore, like all other creeds, was contained
in the Dharma of Buddhism, and the great object
of Gautama&rsquo;s advent was not to uproot the old religion,
but to purify it from error and restore it.</p>
<p>It was on this account that he regarded the Hind&#363;
gods as occupying a place in his own system, though
not without some modification of the nature of their
supposed position, offices, and functions.</p>
<p>And here it will be necessary to give an account of
the later Buddhist theory of twenty-six successive tiers
of heavens, one rising above the other (<a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>).</p>
<p>In the centre of the world-system stands, as we have
seen, the vast mass of the mythical mountain Meru.
On the upper portion of this stupendous axis of the
universe and above the eight chief hells and the
worlds of animals, ghosts, demons, and men, is situated
the lowest heaven of the gods, where abide the four
Mah&#257;-r&#257;jas, &lsquo;great champions,&rsquo; or guardians of the
earth and the heavens against the demons, who are
ever engaged in assailing them from their world below.
These four are represented in full armour, with drawn
swords; one quarter of the heavens being assigned to
the guardianship of each; viz. the East to Dh&#7771;ita-r&#257;sh&#7789;ra,
king of the Gandharvas; the South to Vir&#363;&#7693;haka, king
of the Kumbh&#257;&#7751;&#7693;as; the West to Vir&#363;p&#257;ksha, king of
the N&#257;gas; the North to Kuvera (Vai&#7777;rava&#7751;a), king
of the Yakshas. The inhabitants of this heaven are
called &#262;atur-mah&#257;r&#257;ja-k&#257;yikas,
or simply Mah&#257;r&#257;jika-dev&#257;h&#7717;.
Above this lowest heaven, and on the highest
summit of the world&rsquo;s axis, Meru, is enthroned the god
&#7776;akra (Indra), known in the Veda as god of the atmosphere.
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
He is lord of a heaven of his own, and no
god is more popular among Buddhists or oftener
named in their legends; yet he is inferior to Mah&#257;-brahm&#257;
and to M&#257;ra (<a href="#Page_208">p. 208</a>). Buddha himself was
Indra in some of his births (<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>). To this heaven
he ascended to preach the Law to his mother.</p>
<p>Hence we may infer that in the early days of Buddhism,
Indra, who was perhaps the chief god of the
&#7770;ig-veda, was still the favourite god of the people.</p>
<p>His heaven forms the second tier, reckoning from the
lowest upwards (see <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>), and is called Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a
(T&#257;vati&#7753;sa), that of the thirty-three divinities&mdash;as recognized
in the Vedic hymns&mdash;consisting of the three
groups of eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, and twelve &#256;dityas,
together with personifications of Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>The remaining heavens of the gods, which rise in
succession above the lowest and above Indra&rsquo;s and
therefore in the sky above Mount Meru, are the third,
fourth, fifth, and sixth. These are not illuminated by
the sun and moon, since the gods who live in them give
out a sufficient light from their own persons. The first
of them, or third of the heavens, is inhabited by beings
called Y&#257;mas. They were known to the Br&#257;hmans and
probably presided over the periods of the day. They are
called &lsquo;strifeless,&rsquo; because they have not to take part
in the war constantly being waged by the gods of the
two lower heavens against the demons (Asuras), who
are unable to advance into the regions above Meru.</p>
<p>The fourth heaven is that of the Tushitas or &lsquo;perfectly
contented beings.&rsquo; It is a peculiarly sacred
region, as it is the home of all the Bodhi-sattvas
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
destined to become Buddhas. Gautama Buddha once
dwelt there, and Maitreya now presides in it.</p>
<p>The fifth heaven is inhabited by the Nirm&#257;&#7751;a-rati-dev&#257;&#7717;,
that is, &lsquo;beings who constantly enjoy
pleasures provided by themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sixth heaven, and the highest of the Deva-lokas,
is the abode of the Para-nirmita-va&#7777;a-varti-dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings
who constantly enjoy pleasures provided for them by
others.&rsquo; These beings are also called M&#257;ras, and are
&lsquo;lords of sensuous desires.&rsquo; When the theory of races
of gods was invented, it led to the figment of millions
of M&#257;ras ruled over by a chief M&#257;ra, who tempts men
to indulge their passions (pp. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>, <a href="#Page_33">33</a>, <a href="#Page_41">41</a>), and is always
on the watch to enter the citadel of the body by the
gates of eye, ear, etc. (see <a href="#fn_52">note, p. 129</a>). One of
M&#257;ra&rsquo;s names is K&#257;ma, &lsquo;desire.&rsquo; He is superior to all
the gods of the worlds of sense, even to &#7776;akra or Indra.
In every &#262;akrav&#257;la or Universe of worlds there is a
M&#257;ra. He is sometimes called the Buddhist Satan, but
this is misleading. He is rather a superior god, whose
power consists in exciting sensual or carnal desires.</p>
<p>So far, then, the heavens are all worlds of sense,&mdash;like
the earth and the lower regions,&mdash;and are spheres inhabited
by beings who have sexual feelings and live
active lives. But at this point in the ascent upwards
all sensuality ceases, and we are introduced to beings
who enjoy a higher condition of existence in which
there is no distinction of sex, and all sensuous desires
and objects have lost their hold over the frame&mdash;a
condition supposed to be induced by the exercise of
mystical abstract meditation (Dhy&#257;na, P&#257;li Jh&#257;na).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>The importance of Dhy&#257;na or intense abstract meditation
in the Buddhist system has been pointed out before
(<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>). It is the chief religious exercise in which a
true follower of Buddha can engage, and although it is
divided into four stages, the man who exercises himself
perfectly in any one of the four, becomes so sublimated
and refined that he cannot be re-born in any of the
sensuous heavens, or in any region lower than the
Brahm&#257; worlds.</p>
<p>The first stage of Dhy&#257;na consists in fixing (Dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;)
the mind and at the same time exercising the thinking
faculties on some object, in such a way that a state of
ecstatic joy and serenity is attained.</p>
<p>The second consists in concentrating the mind or soul
so intensely on itself that the thinking faculties cease
to act and only ecstatic joy and serenity remain.</p>
<p>In the third, nothing remains but perfect serenity.</p>
<p>The fourth is a trance-like condition of utter indifference
and torpor, in which there is neither any exercise of
thought, nor any conscious joy or serenity, but the whole
being is released from the fetters of sense and soars
to a transcendental condition, characterized by latent
energy and a power of working miracles (<a href="#Page_133">p. 133</a>).</p>
<p>These four stages of abstract meditation must not be
confused with the four earnest reflections and the five
contemplations (pp. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>, <a href="#Page_127">127</a>), which are not so abstract
and require more earthly objects on which to be exercised.</p>
<p>The fourth and last Dhy&#257;na is also called Sam&#257;dhi,
and properly means such a perfect concentration of
the soul&rsquo;s faculties, that the soul becomes merged in
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
itself. It is often used to denote an ecstatic condition,
scarcely to be distinguished from trance or hypnotism or
catalepsy. Those devotees in India who practise it are
buried, not burnt, and their tombs are called Sam&#257;dhs.</p>
<p>To return now to Buddhist Cosmology, the theory of
later Buddhism is that he who has practised the first
Dhy&#257;na will rise at death to one of the three tiers of
heavens connected with that first Dhy&#257;na, i.e. to the
first and lowest of the four groups of worlds of true form
(r&#363;pa), in which all sexual distinctions are obliterated.</p>
<p>This first or lowest group consists of the worlds of the
Brahm&#257;s, a high order of gods divided into three classes
with three tiers of abodes.</p>
<p>The first class of Brahm&#257; gods, inhabiting the first or
lowest of the tiers of the Brahm&#257; abodes, consists of the
Brahma-parisajj&#257; dev&#257;&#7717;, or beings who constitute the
retinue of the god Mah&#257;-brahm&#257;&mdash;the chief of all the
Buddhist gods.</p>
<p>The second class of Brahm&#257; gods, inhabiting the second
tier, consists of the Brahma-purohit&#257; dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings who
are the ministers of Mah&#257;-brahm&#257;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The third class of Brahm&#257; gods, inhabiting the highest
of the three tiers, consists of the Mah&#257;-brahm&#257;s, &lsquo;great
Brahm&#257;s,&rsquo; of whom Mah&#257;-brahm&#257; is the chief.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of these three worlds are sometimes
called the Brahma-k&#257;yik&#257; dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;gods having a Brahm&#257;
form.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is important, however, to note that Brahm&#257; or
Mah&#257;-brahm&#257;, sometimes called Brahm&#257; Sah&#257;m-pati,
&lsquo;lord of those who have to suffer<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a>,&rsquo; is the king of <i>all</i> the
higher heavens (<a href="#Page_214">p. 214</a>), ruling there, as Mara and Indra
do in the lower worlds and heavens of sense and
desire. Out of deference to Br&#257;hmanism he has been
adopted as the chief god of the Buddhist Pantheon, and
yet he is far inferior to the Buddha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Furthermore, it is to be observed that every &#262;akra-v&#257;la
or &lsquo;system of worlds&rsquo; (see <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>) has its own
Mah&#257;-brahm&#257; ruling over its own higher heavens, and
that as there are countless &#262;akra-v&#257;la, so there are
countless Mah&#257;-brahm&#257;s. Nor is any of these chief gods
eternal. Each has to pass into some other form of
existence at the end of vast periods of time, and is
then succeeded by another. Gautama Buddha himself
was born four times as Mah&#257;-brahm&#257; (see <a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>).</p>
<p>The second group of worlds of true form has also
three tiers of heavens like the first, and is assigned as
an abode to those who have risen to the second degree
of contemplation.</p>
<p>The characteristic of these three heavens is that they
are regions of true light&mdash;not of the sun&rsquo;s light, but of
mental enlightenment, and each of the three is inhabited
by beings who have raised themselves to different heights
of knowledge and intelligence.</p>
<p>In the first are the Par&#299;tt&#257;bh&#257; (Par&#301;tt&#257;bh&#257;) dev&#257;&#7717;,
&lsquo;beings of circumscribed or limited enlightenment;&rsquo; in
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
the second are the Apram&#257;&#7751;&#257;bh&#257; (Appam&#257;&#7751;&#257;bh&#257;) dev&#257;&#7717;,
&lsquo;beings of infinite light;&rsquo; in the third are the &#256;bh&#257;svar&#257;
(&#256;bhassar&#257;) dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings of the clearest light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The third group of worlds of true form has again three
tiers of heavens, which are assigned to those who have
raised themselves to the third stage of contemplation.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of these three seems to be that
they are regions of the greatest purity, and that each of
the three is the abode of beings distinguished by higher
and higher degrees of purity. In the first are the
Par&#299;tta-&#7777;ubh&#257; (Par&#299;tta-subh&#257;) dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;gods or beings
of limited purity;&rsquo; in the second are the Apram&#257;&#7751;a-&#7777;ubh&#257;
(Appam&#257;na-subh&#257;) dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings of unlimited
purity;&rsquo; in the third are the &#7776;ubha-k&#7771;itsn&#257; (Subha-ki&#7751;&#7751;&#257;)
dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings of absolute purity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fourth group of worlds of true form has seven
tiers of heavens, occupied by those beings who have
risen to the fourth or highest grade of abstract meditation
(Dhy&#257;na), which is really a state of meditating on
nothing and of complete indifference to all concrete
objects. These beings are the emancipated Arhats who
have delivered themselves from the cycle (Sa&#7747;s&#257;ra) of
constant re-birth (<a href="#Page_134">p. 134</a>).</p>
<p>In the first tier are the V&#7771;ihat-phal&#257; (Vehapphal&#257;)
dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings enjoying great reward;&rsquo; in the second
are the Asa&ntilde;j&ntilde;i-sattv&#257; (Asa&ntilde;&ntilde;a-satt&#257;) dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings
lost in total unconsciousness;&rsquo; in the third are the
Av&#7771;ih&#257; (Avih&#257;) dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings who make no efforts;&rsquo;
in the fourth are the Atap&#257; (Atapp&#257;) dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings who
never endure any pain;&rsquo; in the fifth are the Sudar&#7777;&#257;
(Sudass&#257;) dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings who see clearly;&rsquo; in the sixth
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
are the Sudar&#7777;ino (Sudass&#299;) dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings of beautiful
appearance;&rsquo; in the seventh are the Akanish&#7789;h&#257; (Akani&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;)
dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;highest of all beings.&rsquo; In this last must
be included all Arhats and Pratyeka-Buddhas.</p>
<p>High above the worlds of true form and above the
abode of pure contemplative beings, rise the four heavens
of formless entities&mdash;beings who have no material frames,
even of the subtlest kind, but are mere abstractions,
such as the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas (pp. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>, <a href="#Page_203">203</a>).</p>
<p>In the first of these formless heavens (Ar&#363;pa-loka)
are the &#256;k&#257;&#7777;&#257;nanty&#257;yatan&#257; dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings who are
capable of conceiving the idea of infinite space;&rsquo; in the
second are the Vij&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;nanty&#257;yatan&#257; dev&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;beings who
are capable of conceiving the idea of infinite intelligence;&rsquo;
in the third are the Aki&ntilde;&#263;any&#257;yatan&#257; dev&#257;&#7717;,
&lsquo;beings who can conceive the idea of absolute nonentity,&rsquo;
or, in other words, that nothing whatever exists anywhere;
in the fourth and highest of all are the Naivasa&ntilde;j&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;sa&ntilde;j&ntilde;&#257;yatan&#257;
dev&#257;&#7717; (Nevasa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;sa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;y&aring;-),
&lsquo;beings who abide in neither consciousness nor unconsciousness.&rsquo;
This is the most sublime of all conditions,
but these heavens belong to mystical Buddhism.</p>

<p>This elaborate description of higher and higher
conditions of future existence may be contrasted with
the reticence of the Bible and its simple allusion to
a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>The description, however, belongs to later Buddhism.
It enables us to understand the true position of the
Buddhist gods. They merely constitute one of the six
classes of beings, and, as they have to go through other
forms of life, are inferior to Arhats and Buddhas.</p>
<p>Mah&#257;-brahm&#257; is often named, whereas Vish&#7751;u, the
popular god of the Hind&#363;s, is neglected. In point of
fact he was, as we have seen, represented by Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i
(Avalokite&#7777;vara, <a href="#Page_198">p. 198</a>), who seems to have taken
his place in later Buddhism.</p>
<p>At all events the more modern form of Vish&#7751;u called
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, who is generally worshipped by the lower
orders of Hind&#363;s as the most popular god of medi&aelig;val
Hind&#363;ism, has not been adopted by the inhabitants of
Buddhist countries.</p>
<p>When I was at Kandy in Ceylon I found one solitary
shrine (Dev&#257;l&#299;) dedicated, not to K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, but to Mah&#257;-Vish&#7751;u.
It was near the well-known Tooth-temple and
appeared almost deserted. The shrine was at the end of
a bare room, and contained a small silver-gilt image of
Mah&#257;-Vish&#7751;u (as Vish&#7751;u is called when worshipped by
Buddhists, just as the chief of the Brahm&#257; gods is
called Mah&#257;-Brahm&#257;) about half a foot high. In the
hands of the image was a thin metal bar with a kind of
locket or amulet suspended from it, while round its
neck was a long rosary and in front of the body a large
plate for offerings. The folding doors of the sanctuary
had representations of the sun and moon.</p>
<p>Turning to the god &#7776;iva, we may note that he was
adopted by later Buddhism in his character of Yog&#299;,
or Mah&#257;-yog&#299; (see &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 83).
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
Then, as the Buddhism of the North very soon became
corrupted with &#7776;aivism and its accompaniments, &#7776;&#257;ktism,
T&#257;ntrism, and Magic, so in Northern countries various
forms of &#7776;iva&mdash;such as Mah&#257;-K&#257;la, Bhairava, Bh&#299;ma&mdash;and
of his wife (P&#257;rvat&#299;, Durg&#257;, etc.), are honoured,
and their images are found in temples. Sometimes
bloody sacrifices are offered to them.</p>
<p>Among the female deities forms of T&#257;r&#257; are chiefly
worshipped, and regarded as &#7776;aktis of the Buddhas.</p>
<p>It is even held by the disciples of the more advanced
Mah&#257;-y&#257;na&mdash;especially in Nep&#257;l&mdash;that there are five
&#7776;aktis or female Energies (corresponding to the five
human Buddhas), whose names are given in corresponding
order thus:&mdash;Vajra-dh&#257;tr&#299;, Lo&#263;an&#257;, M&#257;mak&#299;, P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ar&#257;,
and T&#257;r&#257; or T&#257;r&#257;-dev&#299; (the latter being the T&#257;r&#257; <i>par
excellence</i>)<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a>.</p>
<p>But the goddess T&#257;r&#257; was also worshipped by Buddhists
in India proper; for we find that Hiouen Thsang
alludes to having seen images of T&#257;r&#257; Bodhi-sattva<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a> in
the country of Magadha.</p>
<p>I may mention, too, that in a dilapidated building,
which contains the Vajr&#257;sana or thunderbolt throne
of Gautama at Buddha-Gay&#257; (in the same country
of Magadha), I noticed in a shrine near the temple,
an image of T&#257;r&#257;-dev&#299;, which, from the crown of fresh
flowers encircling its head, appeared to have been recently
worshipped by some Buddhist pilgrims, who
had arrived on the day of my visit in 1876.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>The god Indra, usually called &#7776;akra (Sakka), is, as
we have seen, the most popular god of the early Buddhist
Pantheon (pp. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>, <a href="#Page_207">207</a>). He is a friendly deity and
never exerts evil influences over men, like M&#257;ra. On
the contrary, if any good man is in need of his services
he descends from his own heaven to render assistance;
and the fact of his aid being required is made known
to him by his throne becoming hot.</p>
<p>The Dharma-pada (107, 392) mentions Agni, god of
fire, and again (48), Antaka, god of death, sometimes
identified with M&#257;ra or with Yama, &lsquo;ruler in Hell.&rsquo; A
form of Yama called Yam&#257;ntaka is also recognized.</p>
<p>In Ceylon I observed several shrines to Kanda-Kum&#257;ra,
a form of Skanda (son of &#7776;iva), who is said
to have received the gift of healing from Buddha.</p>
<p>There also I observed shrines of Saman (sometimes
spelt Samanta, sometimes Sumana), the tutelary deity
of Adam&rsquo;s Peak, which is thence called Samanta-k&#363;&#7789;o
and Sumana-k&#363;&#7789;o.</p>
<p>Then there were shrines dedicated to a demoniacal
goddess called Pa&#7789;&#7789;ini (regarded sometimes as protecting
from small-pox), and to certain good and evil genii,
called N&#259;ths (N&#257;thas?) as in Burma.</p>
<p>No doubt the worship of devils and demons existed
in Ceylon long before the introduction of either Br&#257;hmanism
or Buddhism. At Colombo in 1877 I witnessed
a so-called devil-dance, performed late at night before
the then Governor, Sir William Gregory.</p>
<p>First, three men dressed in coarse, loose, jet-black
dresses, engaged in a wild dance together. They had
shaggy hair, blackened faces daubed with white paint,
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
and a set of six or eight long projecting false teeth,
which protruded far below the lower lip, sometimes one,
sometimes two at a time. Their legs were completely
covered with small bells, which rattled like chains when
they moved. In their hands they held three flaring
torches, branching from one handle. At intervals they
increased the glare and smoke from these torches by
sprinkling resin upon them.</p>
<p>Their dance was of the wildest description, in a
circle, sometimes moving in and out, and crossing each
other, and all the while beating the ground violently
with their jingling legs, which kept time to the noisy
music of tom-toms, flagiolets, horns, etc., played by
attendant musicians. These three men were supposed
to represent the various forms of typhus fever. At
intervals during their dance they assumed frightful
black masks with hideous open mouths.</p>
<p>Then with them were two other dancing demons
dressed in red, not so hideous in appearance, who also
danced holding torches. These represented another
form of devil. They danced in the interval of the two
performances of the black devils. There were also three
men dressed in reddish garments, who formed part of the
group and moved about quietly among the others. They
were described to me as devil-charmers or exorcisers.</p>
<p>Every disease&mdash;every calamity has its presiding demon,
and all such demons are the servants of Buddha.</p>
<p>In regard to the other supernatural beings and figments
of Hind&#363; mythology adopted, with a few unimportant
modifications, by Buddhists, the first that call
for mention are the Pretas (see <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>The Pretas are beings of the nature of ghosts and
goblins who have recently inhabited the earth, and are
often of gigantic size and terrific appearance, with dried-up
limbs, hairy countenances, enormous bellies, ever
consumed with hunger and thirst, and yet never able
to eat and drink by reason of their contracted throats.
Some are represented as trying to swallow sparks of
fire; others try to eat up dead bodies, or their own
flesh. Possibly this form of re-birth was invented to
deter the laity from withholding food from the monks.
The Pretas inhabit a region above the hells. Some,
however, assign them habitations above the surface of
the earth or in desert places on the earth itself.</p>
<p>The Asuras or Daityas are evil demons who, like the
Titans of Greek mythology, are always at war with the
gods. They dwell under the foundations of Mount
Meru, as far underneath the surface of the earth as their
great enemy Indra is above it. In short, if he may be
supposed to live at the zenith, they live at the nadir, and
their battle-field is on the slopes of Meru.</p>
<p>Closely connected with them are the R&#257;kshasas, who
are also enemies of the gods and are represented as
monsters of frightful form and man-eating propensities.
They haunt cremation-grounds and cemeteries and way-lay
human beings in solitary places to devour them.</p>
<p>Then there is a class of very malignant demons
called Pi&#7777;&#257;&#263;as (described in &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo;
p. 242), who are the authors of all evils.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Yakshas and Yakshi&#7751;&#299;s are a
class of good genii ruled over by Kuvera, &lsquo;god of
wealth,&rsquo; who is often referred to in Buddhist writings
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
under his patronymic Vai&#7777;rava&#7751;a (P&#257;li Vessava&#7751;o)<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a>.
These beings are commonly represented in sculptures in
human form and held to be harmless, though some
Buddhist legends describe them as cruel. Stories are
told about some of them being converted to Buddhism.</p>
<p>Then come the N&#257;gas, who are constantly alluded to.
They properly belong to a class of serpent-demons,
having human faces with serpent-like lower extremities,
who live in one of the lower regions below the earth
called P&#257;t&#257;la, or under the waters. They are introduced
into Buddhist sculptures as worshippers of the Buddha
and friends of all Buddhists, but usually represented
as ordinary men. The N&#257;ga Mu&#263;alinda (also Mu&#263;ilinda),
who sheltered Buddha, was a real serpent (see <a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>).
N&#257;ga-kany&#257;s or female N&#257;gas (serpents from the waist
downwards) are also not uncommon<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a>. In Kashm&#299;r
N&#257;gas are connected with fountains and the sources of
rivers.</p>
<p>Then there are the Mahoragas, &lsquo;great dragons,&rsquo; who
also belong to the N&#257;ga class of demons.</p>
<p>We ought also to notice the Kumbh&#257;&#7751;&#7693;as, a class of
demons who attend on Vir&#363;&#7693;haka (<a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>); the Garu&#7693;as,
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
a bird-like race ruled over by the mythical Garu&#7693;a,
king of birds and enemy of the N&#257;gas and serpents;
the Apsarases, or nymphs produced at the churning
of the ocean. These last are sometimes described in
Hind&#363; mythology as the H&#363;r&#299;s of Indra&rsquo;s heaven, who
are assigned to heroes killed in battle. In Buddhist
sculptures they are represented as beautiful females,
who are properly the wives of Indra&rsquo;s celestial musicians
called Gandharvas.</p>
<p>Finally, mention should be made of the Kinnaras and
Kinnar&#299;s&mdash;beings who ought properly to be represented
with human bodies and equine heads, and are, like the
Gandharvas, heavenly musicians. It is even recorded
in one legend that the Buddha himself in a former life
was a Kinnar&#299;.</p>
<p>All this proves the close connexion of Buddhism
with the Hind&#363;ism which, like Buddhism, grew out of
Br&#257;hmanism. In short, the one mythology is so interpenetrated
with the other, that Buddhism in making
proselytes throughout Eastern Asia could not avoid
propagating Hind&#363; mythological doctrines along with
its own.</p>
<p>The consequence was that Hind&#363;ism, though often
regarded as an unproselyting and wholly national religion,
really exercised a vast influence outside its own
boundaries and among alien races.</p>
<p>It is, at any rate, a remarkable fact that no mythological
system has ever spread over so large an area of
the earth&rsquo;s surface as that which, originating in India,
was accepted to a great extent by all Buddhist communities.
And this Indo-Buddhistic system of mythology,
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
with its, to us, absurd idolatry, rests on an extremely
subtle form of pantheism, which is not to be
brushed aside as too contemptible for investigation.</p>
<p>It is usual to denounce all such systems as simple
Heathenism; but &lsquo;Heathenism&rsquo; means the religion of
&lsquo;the nations&rsquo;&mdash;the religion evolved by the men of all
countries out of their own imaginations and by their
own natural faculties, without the aid of any true supernatural
revelation.</p>
<p>And assuredly this religion of human nature is still
a strong citadel entrenched behind the formidable forces
of pride, passion, prejudice, and ignorance. Yet the
walls of the fortress have numerous weak places, which
the wise missionary, armed with the still more powerful
forces at his command, will endeavour to discover and
quietly undermine. By patient and quiet working he
must win the day.</p>
<p>With man, speed and rapidity of action are supposed
to be the chief evidences of progress and the chief
factors in success. The Evangelist, on the other hand,
is a worker for God and a fellow-worker with God, and
ought not to be discouraged by the tardy advance of the
Truth which he advocates. He may have his moments
of despondency, but he has only to look around and
observe that God works everywhere throughout His
own Universe by slow and almost imperceptible processes.
The ripe fruit falls from the tree in a second,
but its maturity is not effected without a whole year
of gradual preparation.</p>

<h2 id="c15">LECTURE X.
<br /><i>Mystical Buddhism in its connexion with the Yoga philosophy.</i></h2>
<p>The first idea implied by Buddhism is intellectual
enlightenment. But Buddhism has its own theory
of enlightenment&mdash;its own idea of true knowledge,
which it calls Bodhi, not Veda. By true knowledge
it means knowledge acquired by man through his own
intellectual faculties and through his own inner consciousness,
instincts, and intuitions, unaided by any
external or supernatural revelation of any kind.</p>
<p>But it is important to observe that Buddhism, in
the carrying out of its own theory of entire self-dependence
in the search after truth, was compelled
to be somewhat inconsistent with itself. It enjoined
self-conquest, self-restraint, self-concentration, and separation
from the world for the attainment of true knowledge
and for the accomplishment of its own <i>summum
bonum</i>&mdash;the bliss of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a&mdash;the bliss of deliverance
from the fires of passion and the flames of concupiscence.
Yet it encouraged association and combination for
mutual help. It established a universal brotherhood
of celibate monks, open to persons of all castes and
ranks, to rich and poor, learned and unlearned alike&mdash;a
community of men which might, in theory, be
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
co-extensive with the whole world&mdash;all bound together
by the common aim of self-conquest, all animated by
the wish to aid each other in the battle with carnal
desires, all penetrated by a desire to follow the example
of the Buddha, and be guided by the doctrine or law
which he promulgated.</p>
<p>C&oelig;nobitic monasticism in fact, as we have already
pointed out, became an essential part of true Buddhism
and a necessary instrument for its propagation.</p>
<p>In all this the Buddha showed himself to be eminently
practical in his methods and profoundly wise
in his generation. Evidently, too, he was wise in
abstaining at first from all mystical teaching. Originally
Buddhism set its face against all solitary asceticism
and all secret efforts to attain sublime heights
of knowledge. It had no occult, no esoteric system of
doctrine which it withheld from ordinary men.</p>
<p>Nor did true Buddhism at first concern itself with
any form of philosophical or metaphysical teaching,
which it did not consider helpful for the attainment
of the only kind of true knowledge worth striving
for&mdash;the knowledge of the origin of suffering and its
remedy&mdash;the knowledge that suffering and pain arise
from indulging lusts, and that life is inseparable from
suffering, and is an evil to be got rid of by suppressing
self and extinguishing desires.</p>
<p>In the Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na-sutta (Rhys Davids, II. 32)
is recorded one of the Buddha&rsquo;s remarks shortly before
his decease:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, O &#256;nanda, does the Order desire of me?
I have taught the law (desito dhammo) without making
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
any distinction between esoteric and exoteric doctrine
(anantaram abahiram karitv&#257;). In the matter of the
law, the Tath&#257;gata (i.e. the Buddha) has never had
the closed fist of a teacher (&#257;&#263;ariya-mu&#7789;&#7789;hi)&mdash;of a teacher
who withholds some doctrines and communicates others.&rsquo;
In short, he was opposed to mysticism.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, admitting, as we must, that early
Buddhism had no mysteries reserved for a privileged
circle, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that the
great importance attached to abstract meditation in
the Buddhist system could not fail in the end to encourage
the growth of mystical ideas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is undeniable that such ideas were,
in some countries, carried to the most extravagant
extremes. Efforts to induce a trance-like or hypnotic
condition, by abstracting the thoughts from all bodily
influences, by recitation of mystical sentences, and by
superstitious devices for the acquisition of supernatural
faculties, were placed above good works and all the
duties of the moral code.</p>
<p>We might point, too, to the strange doctrine which
arose in Nep&#257;l and Tibet&mdash;the doctrine of the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas
(or &lsquo;Buddhas of Meditation&rsquo;)&mdash;certain abstract
Essences existing in the formless worlds of thought,
who were held to be ethereal and eternal representatives
of the transitory earthly Buddhas. These have
been adverted to in a previous Lecture (see <a href="#Page_202">p. 202</a>).</p>
<p>Our present concern is rather with the growth
and development of mystical Buddhism in India itself,
through its connexion with the system of philosophy
called Yoga and Yog&#257;&#263;&#257;ra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>The close relationship of Buddhism to that system is
well known; but the various practices included under
the name Yoga did not owe their origin to Buddhism.
They were prevalent in India before Gautama Buddha&rsquo;s
time; and one of the most generally accepted facts
in his biography is that, after abandoning his home
and worldly associations, he resorted to certain Br&#257;hman
ascetics, who were practising Yoga.</p>
<p>What then was the object which these ascetics had
in view?</p>
<p>The word Yoga literally means &lsquo;union&rsquo; (as derived
from the Sansk&#7771;it root &lsquo;yuj,&rsquo; to join; compare the
English word &lsquo;yoke&rsquo;), and the proper aim of every
man who practised Yoga was the mystic union (or
rather re-union) of his own spirit with the one eternal
Soul or Spirit of the Universe. A true Yog&#299;, says the
Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (VI. 13, 25), should be indifferent to all
earthly things. To him a clod, a stone, and gold
should be all alike.</p>
<p>Doubtless this was the Buddha&rsquo;s first aim when he
addressed himself to Yoga in the fifth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and
even to this hour, earnest men in India resort to this
system with the same object.</p>
<p>In the Indian Magazine for July, 1887 (as well as
in my &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 529), is a short
biography of a quite recent religious reformer named
Sv&#257;m&#299; Day&#257;nanda-Sarasvat&#299;, whose acquaintance I made
at Bombay in 1876 and 1877, and who only died in
1883. The story of his life reads almost like a repetition
of the life of Buddha, though his teaching aimed at restoring
the supposed monotheistic doctrine of the Veda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>It is recorded that his father, desiring to initiate
him into the mysteries of &#7776;aivism, took him to a
shrine dedicated to the god &#7776;iva; but the sight of
some mice stealing the consecrated offerings, and of
some rats playing on the heads of the idol, led him
to disbelieve in &#7776;iva-worship as a means of union with
the Supreme Being. Longing, however, for such
union and for emancipation from the burden of repeated
births, he resolved to renounce marriage and
abandon the world. Accordingly, at the age of twenty-two,
he clandestinely quitted his home, the darkness
of evening covering his flight. Taking a secret path,
he travelled thirty miles during the night. Next day
he was pursued by his father, who tried to force him
to return, but in vain. After travelling farther and
farther from his native province, he took a vow to
devote himself to the investigation of truth. Then
he wandered for many years all over India, trying to
gain knowledge from sages and philosophers, but without
any satisfactory result, till finally he settled at
Ahmed&#257;b&#257;d. There, having mastered the higher Yoga
system, he became the leader of a new sect called
the &#256;rya-Sam&#257;j.</p>
<p>And here we may observe that the expression &lsquo;higher
Yoga&rsquo; implies that a lower form of that system had been
introduced. In point of fact, the Yoga system grew,
and became twofold&mdash;that is, it came in the end to
have two objects.</p>
<p>The earlier was the higher Yoga. It aimed only
at union with the Spirit of the Universe. The more
developed system aimed at something more. It sought
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
to acquire miraculous powers by bringing the body
under control of the will, and by completely abstracting
the soul from body and mind, and isolating it in its
own essence. This condition is called Kaivalya.</p>
<p>In the fifth century B.C., when Gautama Buddha
began his career, the later and lower form of Yoga
seems to have been little known. Practically, in those
days, earnest and devout men craved only for union
with the Supreme Being, and absorption into his Essence.
Many methods of effecting such union and absorption
were contrived. And these may be classed under two
chief heads&mdash;bodily mortification (tapas) and abstract
meditation (dhy&#257;na).</p>
<p>By either one of these two chief means, the devotee
was supposed to be able to get rid of all bodily fetters&mdash;to
be able to bring his bodily organs into such subjection
to the spiritual that he became unconscious of
possessing any body at all. It was in this way that
his spirit became fit for blending with the Universal
Spirit, of which it was originally a part.</p>
<p>We learn from the Lalita-vistara that various forms
of bodily torture, self-maceration, and austerity were
common in Gautama&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Some devotees, we read, seated themselves in one
spot and kept perpetual silence, with their legs bent
under them. Some ate only once a day or once on
alternate days, or at intervals of four, six, or fourteen
days. Some slept in wet clothes or on ashes,
gravel, stones, boards, thorny grass, or spikes, or
with the face downwards. Some went naked, making
no distinction between fit or unfit places. Some
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
smeared themselves with ashes, cinders, dust, or clay.
Some inhaled smoke and fire. Some gazed at the sun,
or sat surrounded by five fires, or rested on one foot,
or kept one arm perpetually uplifted, or moved about
on their knees instead of on their feet, or baked themselves
on hot stones, or submerged themselves in water,
or suspended themselves in air.</p>
<p>Then, again, a method of fasting called very painful
(atik&#7771;i&#263;&#263;hra), described by Manu (XI. 213), was often
practised. It consisted in eating only a single mouthful
every day for nine days, and then abstaining from all
food for the three following days.</p>
<p>Another method, called the lunar fast (VI. 20, XI.
216), consisted in beginning with fifteen mouthfuls at
full moon, and reducing the quantity by one mouthful
till new moon, and then increasing it again in the same
way till full moon.</p>
<p>Passages without number might be quoted from
ancient literature to prove that similar practices were
resorted to throughout India, with the object of bringing
the body into subjection to the spirit. And these
practices have continued up to the present day.</p>
<p>A Muhammadan traveller, whose narrative is quoted
by Mr. Mill (British India, i. 355), once saw a man
standing motionless with his face towards the sun.</p>
<p>The same traveller, having occasion to revisit the
same spot sixteen years afterwards, found the very
same man in the very same attitude. He had gazed
on the sun&rsquo;s disk till all sense of external vision was
extinguished.</p>
<p>A Yog&#299; was seen not very long ago (Mill&rsquo;s India,
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
i. 353) seated between four fires on a quadrangular
stage. He stood on one leg gazing at the sun, while
these fires were lighted at the four corners. Then
placing himself upright on his head, with his feet
elevated in the air, he remained for three hours in that
position. He then seated himself cross-legged, and
continued bearing the raging heat of the sun above his
head and the fires which surrounded him, till the end
of the day, occasionally adding combustibles with his
own hands to increase the flames.</p>
<p>I, myself, in the course of my travels, encountered
Yogis who had kept their arms uplifted for years, or
had wandered about from one place of pilgrimage to
another under a perpetual vow of silence, or had no
place to lie upon but a bed of spikes.</p>
<p>As to fasting, the idea that attenuation of the body
by abstinence from food facilitates union of the human
soul with the divine, or at any rate promotes a keener
insight into spiritual things, is doubtless as common in
Europe as in Asia; but the most austere observer of
Lent in European countries would be hopelessly outdone
by devotees whose extraordinary powers of abstinence
may be witnessed in every part of India.</p>
<p>If we now turn to the second method of attaining
mystic union with the Divine Essence, namely, by
profound abstract thought, we may observe that it, too,
was everywhere prevalent in Buddha&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the names given by Indian philosophers
to the One Universal Spirit is &#262;it, &lsquo;Thought.&rsquo;
By that name, of course, is meant pure abstract thought,
or the faculty of thought separated from every concrete
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
object. Hence, in its highest state the eternal
infinite Spirit, by its very nature, thinks of nothing.
It is the simple thought-faculty, wholly unconnected
with any object about which it thinks. In point of
fact, the moment it begins to exercise this faculty, it
necessarily abandons for a time its condition of absolute
oneness, abstraction, and isolation, to associate itself
with something inferior, which is not itself.</p>
<p>It follows, therefore, that intense concentration of
the mind on the One Universal Spirit amounts to fixing
the thought on a mere abstract Essence, which reciprocates
no thought in return, and is not conscious
of being thought about by its worshipper.</p>
<p>In harmony with this theory, we find that the definition
of Yoga, in the second aphorism of the Yoga-s&#363;tra,
is, &lsquo;the suppression (nirodha) of the functions or
modifications (v&#7771;itti) of the thinking principle (&#263;itta).&rsquo;
So that, in reality, the union of the human mind with
the infinite Principle of thought amounts to such complete
mental absorption, that thought itself becomes
lost in pure thought.</p>
<p>In the &#7776;akuntal&#257; (VII. 175) there is a description of
an ascetic engaged in this form of Yoga, whose condition
of fixed meditation and immovable impassiveness
had lasted so long that ants had thrown up a mound
as high as his waist, and birds had built their nests in
the long clotted tresses of his tangled hair.</p>
<p>Not many years ago, I, myself, saw at Allah&#257;b&#257;d
near the fort a devotee who had maintained a sitting,
contemplative posture, with his feet folded under his
body, in one place for twenty years. During the Mutiny
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
cannon thundered over his head, and bullets hissed
around him, but nothing apparently disturbed his attitude
of profound meditation. Even Muhammadans
practise the same. The Russian correspondent of the
<i>Times</i> states (Sept. 18, 1888) that he saw in a mosque
at Samarkand men who voluntarily remained mute
and motionless for forty days. On a curtain being
pulled aside he beheld a motionless figure seated in
profound meditation like a squatting mummy. The
guide said that a cannon fired off in front of his face
would have left him equally unmoved.</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that, supposing Gautama to have
made up his mind to devote himself to a religious
life, his adoption of a course of profound meditation
was a most usual proceeding.</p>
<p>A large number of the images of Buddha represent
him sitting on a raised seat or throne (called the Bodhi-ma&#7751;&#7693;a),
with his legs folded under his body, and his
eyes half-closed, in a condition of abstraction (sam&#257;dhi)&mdash;sometimes
called Yoga-nidr&#257;; that is, a trance-like
state, resembling profound sleep. (Compare frontispiece.)</p>
<p>He is said to have seated himself in this way under
four trees in succession (see <a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a> of these Lectures),
namely, under the Bodhi-tree or sacred fig-tree, under
the Banyan-tree, under the Mu&#263;alinda-tree (protected
by the serpent), and under the R&#257;j&#257;yatana-tree.</p>
<p>And those four successive seats probably symbolized
the four recognized stages of meditation<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a> (dhy&#257;na)
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
rising one above the other, till thought itself was converted
into non-thought (see <a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>).</p>
<p>We know, too, that the Buddha went through still
higher progressive stages of meditation at the moment
of his death or final decease (Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a), thus described
in the Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na-sutta (Davids, VI. 11):</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the Venerable One entered into the first stage
of meditation (pathamajjh&#257;nam); and rising out of the
first stage, he passed into the second; and rising out
of the second, he passed into the third; and rising out
of the third, he passed into the fourth; and rising
out of the fourth stage, he attained the conception of
the infinity of space (&#257;k&#257;&#7777;&#257;na&ntilde;&#263;&#257;yatanam, see <a href="#Page_214">p. 214</a>);
and rising out of the conception of the infinity of
space, he attained the conception of the infinity of
intelligence (vi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a&ntilde;&#263;&#257;yatanam); and rising out of the
idea of the infinity of intelligence, he attained the
conception of absolute nonentity (&#257;ki&ntilde;&#263;a&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;yatanam);
and rising out of the idea of nonentity, he entered the
region where there is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness;
and rising out of that region, he entered
the state in which all sensation and perception of ideas
had wholly ceased.&rsquo; (See <a href="#Page_213">p. 213</a> of these Lectures.)</p>
<p>Clearly, even four progressive stages of abstraction
did not satisfy the requirements of later Buddhism in
regard to the intense sublimation of the thinking
faculty needed for the complete effacement of all sense
of individuality. Higher and higher altitudes had to
be reached, insomuch that the fourth stage of abstract
meditation is sometimes divided and subdivided into
what are called eight Vimokhas and eight Sam&#257;pattis&mdash;all
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
of them forms and stages of ecstatic meditation<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a>.</p>
<p>A general name, however, for all the higher trance-like
states is <i>Sam&#257;dhi</i>, and by the practice of Sam&#257;dhi
the six transcendent faculties (Abhi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;) might ultimately
be obtained, viz. the inner ear, or power of
hearing words and sounds, however distant (clair-audience,
as it might be called); the inner eye, or power of
seeing all that happens in every part of the world
(clair-voyance); knowledge of the thoughts of others;
recollection of former existences; the knowledge of the
mode of destroying the corrupting influences of passion;
and, finally, the supernatural powers called Iddhi, to
be subsequently explained.</p>
<p>But to return to the Buddha&rsquo;s first course of meditation
at the time when he first attained Buddhahood.
This happened during one particular night, which was
followed by the birthday of Buddhism.</p>
<p>And what was the first grand outcome of that first
profound mental abstraction? One legend relates that
in the first watch of the night all his previous existences
flashed across his mind; in the second he understood
all present states of being; in the third he traced out
the chain of causes and effects, and at the dawn of day
he knew all things.</p>
<p>According to another legend, there was an actual
outburst of the divine light before hidden within him.</p>
<p>We read in the Lalita-vistara (chap. i) that at the
supreme moment of his intellectual illumination brilliant
flames of light issued from the crown of his head,
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
through the interstices of his cropped hair. These
rays are sometimes represented in his images, emerging
from his skull in a form resembling the five fingers of
an extended hand (see the frontispiece).</p>
<p>Mark, however, that Gautama&rsquo;s meditation never
led him to the highest result of the true Yoga of
Indian philosophy&mdash;union with the Supreme Spirit.
On the contrary, his self-enlightenment led to entire
disbelief in the separate existence of any eternal, infinite
Spirit at all&mdash;any Spirit, in fact, with which a
spirit existing in his own body could blend, or into
which it could be absorbed.</p>
<p>If the Buddha was not a materialist, in the sense of
believing in the eternal existence of material atoms,
neither could he in any sense be called a &lsquo;spiritualist,&rsquo;
or believer in the eternal existence of abstract spirit.</p>
<p>With him Creation did not proceed from an Omnipotent
Spirit or Mind evolving phenomena out of itself
by the exercise of will, nor from an eternal self-existing,
self-evolving germ of any kind. As to the
existence in the Universe of any spiritual substance
which was not matter and was imperceptible by the
senses, it could not be proved.</p>
<p>Nor did he believe in the eternal existence of an
invisible Self or Ego, called Soul, distinct from a
material body. The only eternity of true Buddhism
was an eternity of &lsquo;becoming,&rsquo; not of &lsquo;being&rsquo;&mdash;an
eternity of existences, all succeeding each other, and
all lapsing into nothingness. If there were any
personal gods they were all inferior to the perfect man,
and all liable to change and dissolution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>In brief, the Buddha&rsquo;s enlightenment consisted, first,
in the discovery of the origin and remedy of suffering,
and, next, in the knowledge of the existence of an
eternal Force&mdash;a force generated by what in Sansk&#7771;it
is called Karman, &lsquo;Act.&rsquo; The accumulated force of the
acts of one Universe produced another.</p>
<p>Every man, therefore, was created by the force of
his own acts in former bodies, combined with a force
generated by intense attachment to existence (up&#257;d&#257;na).
Who or what started the first act, the Buddha never
pretended to be able to explain. He confessed himself
in regard to this point a downright Agnostic. The
Buddha himself had been created by his own acts,
and had been created and re-created through countless
bodily forms; but he had no spirit or soul existing
separately between the intervals of each creation. By
his protracted meditation he attained to no higher
knowledge than this, and although he himself rose to
loftier heights of knowledge than any other man of
his day, he never aspired to other faculties than were
within the reach of any human being capable of rising
to the same sublime abstraction of mind.</p>
<p>He was even careful to lay down a precept that the
acquisition of transcendent human faculties was restricted
to the perfected saints called Arhats; and so
important did he consider it to guard such faculties
from being claimed by mere impostors, that one of the
four prohibitions communicated to all monks on first
admission to his monastic Order was that they were
not to pretend to such powers (see <a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a>).</p>
<p>Nor is there any proof that even Arhats in Gautama&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
time were allowed to claim <i>superhuman</i> faculties and
the power of working physical miracles.</p>
<p>By degrees, no doubt, powers of this kind were
ascribed to them as well as to the Buddha. Even in
the Yinaya, one of the oldest portions of the Tri-pi&#7789;aka,
we find it stated (Mah&#257;-vagga I. 20, 24) that Gautama
Buddha gained adherents by performing three
thousand five hundred supernatural wonders (P&#257;li, p&#257;&#7789;i-h&#257;riya;
see <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>). These were thought to be evidences
of his mission as a great teacher and saviour of mankind;
but the part of the narrative recording these,
although very ancient, is probably a legendary addition.</p>
<p>It is interesting, however, to trace in portions of
the early literature, the development of the doctrine
that Buddhahood meant first transcendent knowledge,
and then supernatural faculties and the power of working
miracles.</p>
<p>In the &#256;ka&#7749;kheyya-sutta (said to have been composed
in the fourth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>) occurs a remarkable passage,
translated by Prof. Rhys Davids (S.B.E., p. 214):&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a monk should desire through the destruction of
the corrupting influences (&#257;savas), by himself, and even
in this very world, to know and realise and attain to
Arhatship, to emancipation of heart, and emancipation
of mind, let him devote himself to that quietude of
heart which springs from within, let him not drive back
the ecstasy of contemplation, let him look through
things, let him be much alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a monk should desire to hear with clear and
heavenly ear, surpassing that of men, sounds both
human and celestial, whether far or near; if he should
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
desire to comprehend by his own heart the hearts of
other beings and of other men; if he should desire to
call to mind his various temporary states in the past,
such as one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, a hundred,
a thousand, a hundred thousand births, or his births in
many an age and &aelig;on of destruction and renovation, let
him devote himself to that quietude which springs from
within.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, in the Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na-sutta (I. 33, Rhys
Davids) occurs the following;&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At that time the blessed One&mdash;as instantaneously
as a strong man would stretch forth his arm, or draw it
back again when he had stretched it forth&mdash;vanished
from this side of the river, and stood on the further
bank with the company of the brethren.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, again, the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I call to mind, &#256;nanda, how when I used to enter
into an assembly of many hundred nobles, before I had
seated myself there, or talked to them, or started a
conversation with them, I used to become in colour like
unto their colour, and in voice like unto their voice.
Then, with religious discourse, I used to instruct, incite,
and quicken them, and fill them with gladness. But
they knew me not when I spoke, and would say, &ldquo;Who
may this be who thus speaks? a man or a god?&rdquo; Then,
having instructed, incited, quickened, and gladdened
them with religious discourse, I would vanish away.
But they knew me not even when I vanished away;
and would say, &ldquo;Who may this be who has thus vanished
away? a man, or a god?&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;(Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na-sutta
III. 22, Rhys Davids.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Such passages in the early literature afford an interesting
exemplification of the growth of supernatural and
mystical ideas, which led to the ultimate association of
the Buddhistic system with &#7776;aivism, demonology, magic,
and various so-called spiritual phenomena.</p>
<p>I now proceed to show that the development of these
ideas in Buddhism resulted from its connexion with
the later Yoga, which developed similar ideas.</p>
<p>In the aphorisms of this later Yoga, composed by
Pata&ntilde;jali, eight chief requisites are enumerated (II.
29); namely, 1. abstaining from five evil acts (yama);
2. performing five positive duties (niyama); 3. settling
the limbs in certain postures (&#257;sana); 4. regulating and
suppressing the breath (pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma); 5. withdrawing the
senses from their objects (praty&#257;h&#257;ra); 6. fixing the thinking
faculty (dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;); 7. internal self-contemplation
(dhy&#257;na); 8. trance-like self-concentration (sam&#257;dhi).</p>
<p>These eight are indispensable requisites for the gaining
of Pata&ntilde;jali&rsquo;s <i>summum bonum</i>&mdash;the complete abstraction
or isolation (kaivalya) of the soul or spirit in its
own essence&mdash;and for the acquirement of supernatural
faculties.</p>
<p>Taking now these eight requisites of Yoga in order,
we may observe, with regard to the first, that the five
evil acts to be avoided correspond to the five commandments
in Buddhism, viz. &lsquo;kill not,&rsquo; &lsquo;steal not,&rsquo; &lsquo;commit
no impurity,&rsquo; &lsquo;lie not.&rsquo; The fifth alone&mdash;&lsquo;abstain from
all worldly enjoyments&rsquo;&mdash;is different, the Buddhist fifth
prohibition being &lsquo;drink no strong drink&rsquo; (<a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>).</p>
<p>With regard to the second requisite, the five positive
duties are&mdash;self-purification, both external and internal
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
(both called &#7777;au&#263;a); the practice of contentment (sa&#7747;tosha);
bodily mortification (tapas); muttering of
prayers, or repetition of mystical syllables (sv&#257;dhy&#257;ya,
or japa), and contemplation of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>The various processes of bodily mortification already
described (see <a href="#Page_228">p. 228</a>) were repudiated by Buddhism.</p>
<p>As to the muttering of prayers, the repetition of
mystic syllables such as Om (a symbol for the Triad of
gods), or of any favourite deity&rsquo;s name, is held among
Hind&#363;s to be highly efficacious<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a>. In a similar manner
among Tibetan Buddhists the six-syllabled sentence:
&lsquo;Om ma&#7751;i padme H&#363;m&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Om! the jewel in the
lotus! H&#363;m!&rsquo;&mdash;is used as a charm against the sixfold
course of transmigration (see pp. <a href="#Page_121">121</a>, <a href="#Page_371">371</a>-373).</p>
<p>Mystical syllables are very common. Sir A. Cunningham
gives the following as current in Lad&#257;k:&mdash;Bhyo,
Rakmo-bhyo! Rakmo-bhyo-bhyo! Ru-lu, Ru-lu, H&#363;m
Bhyo H&#363;m! (Lad&#257;k, 386.)</p>
<p>Other mystical syllables (such as Sam, Yam, Ram,
Lam, etc.) are supposed to contain some occult virtue.</p>
<p>The third requisite&mdash;posture&mdash;would appear to us a
somewhat trivial aid to the union of the human spirit
with the divine; but with Hind&#363;s it is an important
auxiliary, fraught with great benefit to the Yog&#299;.</p>
<p>The alleged reason is that certain sitting postures
(&#257;sana) and cramping of the lower limbs are peculiarly
efficacious in producing bodily quietude and preventing
restlessness. Some of the postures have curious names,
for example:&mdash;Padm&#257;sana, &lsquo;the lotus posture;&rsquo;
&lsquo;v&#299;r&#257;sana,
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
&lsquo;the heroic posture;&rsquo; si&#7753;h&#257;sana, &lsquo;the lion posture&rsquo;
(see <a href="#fn_155">note, p. 336</a>); k&#363;rm&#257;sana, &lsquo;tortoise posture;&rsquo;
kukku-&#7789;&#257;sana,
&lsquo;cock posture;&rsquo; dhanur-&#257;sana, &lsquo;bow posture;&rsquo;
may&#363;r&#257;sana, &lsquo;peacock posture.&rsquo; In the first the legs
are folded under the body and the right foot is placed
on the left thigh, and the left on the right thigh.</p>
<p>In short, the idea is that compression of the lower
limbs, in such a way as to prevent the possibility of the
slightest movement, is most important as a preparation
for complete abstraction of soul.</p>
<p>Then, as another aid, particular mystical twistings
(called mudr&#257;) of the upper limbs&mdash;of the arms, hands,
and fingers&mdash;are enjoined.</p>
<p>Even in Muhammadan countries certain movements
of the limbs are practised by devotees with the view
of uniting the human spirit with the Divine. Those who
have seen the whirling and &lsquo;howling&rsquo; dervishes at Cairo
can testify that fainting fits result from their violent
exertions, inspirations, expirations, and utterances of the
name of God, and such fits are believed to be ecstatic
states of union with the Deity.</p>
<p>The fourth requisite&mdash;regulation and suppression of
the breath&mdash;is perhaps the one of all the eight which
is most difficult for Europeans to understand or appreciate;
yet with Hind&#363;s it is all-important. It is sometimes
called Ha&#7789;ha-vidy&#257;. Nor are the ideas connected
with it wholly unknown in Europe.</p>
<p>According to Swedenborg<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a>, thought commences and
corresponds with respiration:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&lsquo;When a man thinks quickly his breath vibrates with
rapid alternations; when the tempest of anger shakes
his mind his breath is tumultuous; when his soul is
deep and tranquil, so is his respiration.&rsquo; And he adds:
&lsquo;It is strange that this correspondence between the
states of the brain or mind and the lungs has not been
admitted in science.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Hind&#363; belief certainly is that deep inspirations
of breath assist in concentrating and abstracting the
thoughts and preventing external impressions. But,
more than this, five sorts of air are supposed to permeate
the human body and play an important part in
its vitality. They are called Pr&#257;&#7751;a, Vy&#257;na, Ap&#257;na,
Sam&#257;na, Ud&#257;na. In the &#262;h&#257;ndogya Upanishad (V.
19, etc.) they are described as if they were divine
beings to be adored and to be honoured by offerings
of food. The Ha&#7789;ha-d&#299;pik&#257; says: &lsquo;As long as the air
remains in the body, so long life remains. Death is
the exit of the breath. Hence the air should be retained
in the body.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In regulating the breath, the air must first be drawn
up through one nostril (the other being closed with the
finger), retained in the lungs, and then expelled through
the other nostril. This exercise must be practised
alternately with the right and left nostril. Next, the
breath must be drawn forcibly up through both nostrils,
and the air imprisoned for as long a time as possible
in the lungs. Thence it must be forced by an effort
of will towards the internal organs of the body, or
made to mount to the centre of the brain.</p>
<p>The Hind&#363;s, however, do not identify the breath
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
with the soul. They believe that a crevice or suture
called the Brahma-randhram at the top of the skull
serves as an outlet for the escape of the soul at death.
A Hind&#363; Yog&#299;&rsquo;s skull is sometimes split at death by
striking it with a sacred shell. The idea is to facilitate
the exit of the soul. It is said that in Tibet the hair is
torn out of the top of the head, with the same object.</p>
<p>In the case of a wicked man the soul is supposed to
escape through one of the lower openings of the body.</p>
<p>The imprisonment of the breath in the body by
taking in more air than is necessary for respiration, is
the most important of the breath exercises. It is said
that Hind&#363; ascetics, by constant practice, are able by
this means to sustain life under water, or to be buried
alive for long periods of time. Many alleged feats of
suspended animation are of course mere and sheer
trickery. It seems, however, open to question, whether
it may not be possible for human beings of particular
constitutions to practise a kind of hibernation like
that of animals, or acquire some power of suspending
temporarily the organic functions. A certain Colonel
Townsend is said to have succeeded in doing so.</p>
<p>A well-known instance of suspended animation occurred
in the Panj&#257;b in 1837. A Hind&#363; Yog&#299; was
there, by his own request, buried alive in a vault for
forty days in the presence of Runjit Singh and Sir
Claude Wade; his eyes, ears, and every orifice of his
body having been first stopped with plugs of wax.
Dr. McGregor, the then residency surgeon, also watched
the case. Every precaution was taken to prevent
deception. English officials saw the man buried, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
well as exhumed, and a perpetual guard over the vault
was kept night and day by order of Runjit Singh
himself. At the end of forty days the disinterment
took place. The body was dried up like a stick, and
the tongue, which had been turned back into the
throat, had become like a piece of horn. Those who
exhumed him followed his previously-given directions
for the restoration of animation, and the Yog&#299; told
them he had only been conscious of a kind of ecstatic
bliss in the society of other Yog&#299;s and saints, and was
quite ready to be buried over again.</p>
<p>What amount of fraud there may be in these
feats it is difficult to say. They may possibly be
accounted for by the fact that Indian Yog&#299;s have studied
the habits of hibernating animals; but in some cases
the secret introduction of food has been detected.</p>
<p>I may add that it is commonly believed throughout
India that a man whose body is sublimated by intense
abstract meditation never dies, in the sense of undergoing
corruption and dissolution. When his supposed
death occurs he is held to be in a state of trance, which
may last for centuries, and his body is, therefore, not
burnt, but buried&mdash;generally in a sitting posture&mdash;and
his tomb is called a Sam&#257;dh.</p>
<p>With regard to the fifth requisite&mdash;the act of withdrawing
the senses from their object, as, for example,
the eye from visible forms&mdash;this is well compared to
the act of a tortoise withdrawing its limbs under its
shell.</p>
<p>The sixth requisite&mdash;fixing the principle of thought&mdash;comprises
the act of directing the thinking faculty
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
(&#263;itta) towards various parts of the body, for example,
towards the heart, or towards the crown of the head,
or concentrating the will-force on the region between
the two eyebrows, or even fixing the eyes intently on
the tip of the nose. (Compare Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; VI. 13.)</p>
<p>The seventh and eighth requisites&mdash;viz. internal self-contemplation
and intense self-concentration&mdash;are held
(when conjoined with the sixth) to be most important
as leading to the acquisition of certain supernatural
powers, of which the following are most commonly
enumerated:&mdash;(1) Animan, &lsquo;the faculty of reducing
the body to the size of an atom;&rsquo; (2) Mahiman, or
Gariman, &lsquo;increasing the size or weight at will;&rsquo; (3)
Laghiman, &lsquo;making the body light at will;&rsquo; (4)Pr&#257;pti,
&lsquo;reaching or touching any object or spot, however
apparently distant;&rsquo; (5) Pr&#257;k&#257;mya, &lsquo;unlimited exercise
of will;&rsquo; (6) &#298;&#7777;itva, &lsquo;gaining absolute power over
one&rsquo;s self and others;&rsquo; (7) Va&#7777;it&#257;, &lsquo;bringing the elements
into subjection;&rsquo; (8) K&#257;m&#257;vas&#257;yit&#257;, &lsquo;the power
of suppressing all desires.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Yog&#299; who has acquired these powers can rise aloft
to the skies, fly through space, pass through the key-hole
of a door, pierce the mysteries of planets and
stars, cause storms and earthquakes, understand the
language of animals, ascertain what occurs in any part
of the world, or of the universe, recollect the events
of his own previous lives, prolong his present life,
see into the past and future, discern the thoughts
of others, assume any form he likes, disappear, reappear,
and even enter into another man&rsquo;s body and make it
his own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Such were some of the extravagant ideas which
grew with the growth of the Yoga system, and
were incorporated into the later developments of Buddhism.</p>
<p>We learn from Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s that in the
monastery of Galdan in Tibet there is at this moment a
college specially devoted to the teaching of Esoteric
and Mystical Buddhism; while magic and sorcery are
taught in the monasteries founded by Padma-sambhava
(see pp. <a href="#Page_272">272</a>, <a href="#Page_274">274</a>, <a href="#Page_441">441</a>).</p>
<p>Of course it was only natural that, with the association
of Buddhism with the later Yoga and &#7776;aivism,
the Buddha himself should have become a centre for
the growth of supernatural and mystical ideas.</p>
<p>Hence the Buddha is fabled by his followers to
have ascended to the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a heaven of Indra,
walked on water, stepped from one mountain to another,
and left impressions of his feet on the solid rock.
Although in the Dhamma-pada it is twice declared
(254, 255), &lsquo;There is no path through the air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the climax was reached when the later
doctrine made every Buddha possess a threefold existence
or three bodies, much in the same way as
in Hind&#363;ism three bodies are assigned to every
being.</p>
<p>The first of the Buddha&rsquo;s bodies is the Dharma-k&#257;ya,
&lsquo;body of the Law,&rsquo; supposed to be a kind of ethereal
essence of a highly sublimated nature and co-extensive
with space. This essence was believed to be eternal,
and after the Buddha&rsquo;s death, was represented by the
Law or Doctrine (Dharma) he taught. The idea seems
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
to have been invented as an analogue to Brahman, or
the Universal spiritual Essence of Br&#257;hmanism<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a>.</p>
<p>The second body is the Sambhoga-k&#257;ya, &lsquo;body of
conscious bliss,&rsquo; which is of a less ethereal and more
material nature than the last. Its Br&#257;hmanical analogue
appears to be the intermediate body (belonging
to departed spirits) called Bhoga-deha, which is of an
ethereal character, though composed of sufficiently
gross (sth&#363;la) material particles to be capable of
experiencing happiness or misery.</p>
<p>For observe that it is an essential part of the Hind&#363;
doctrine of transmigration or metempsychosis, that a
soul <i>without a body</i> is incapable of feeling either happiness
in heaven or pain in hell.</p>
<p>The third body is the Nirm&#257;&#7751;a-k&#257;ya, &lsquo;body of visible
shapes and transformations,&rsquo; that is to say, those various
concrete material forms in which every Buddha who
exists as an invisible and eternal essence, is manifested
on the earth or elsewhere for the propagation of the
true doctrine.</p>
<p>The Br&#257;hmanical analogue of this third body appears
to be the earthly gross body, called Sth&#363;la-&#7777;ar&#299;ra.</p>
<p>It is evident that the extravagances of mystical Buddhism
have their counterparts in Br&#257;hmanism.</p>
<p>There is a Br&#257;hmanical legend which relates how the
great Br&#257;hman sage &#7776;a&#7749;kar&#257;&#263;&#257;rya entranced his gross
body, and then, having forced out his soul along with
his subtle body, entered the dead body of a recently
deceased king, which he occupied for several weeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>The Yoga of the Br&#257;hmans, in fact, held that adepts,
skilled in occult science, might throw their gross
bodies into a state of unconsciousness, and by a determined
effort of will project or force out the ethereal
body through the pores of the skin, and make this
phantasmal form visible in distant places<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a>.</p>
<p>And now it is declared to be a fact that a community
of Buddhist &lsquo;Brothers&rsquo; called Mah&#257;tmas, are
living at this moment in the deserts of Tibet, who,
having emancipated their interior selves from physical
bondage by profound abstract meditation, have acquired
&lsquo;astral&rsquo; bodies (distinct from their gross bodies), with
which they are able to rise in the air, or move through
space, by the mere exercise of will.</p>
<p>Sir Edwin Arnold on the other hand, in his &lsquo;India
Revisited&rsquo; (p. 273), states that he asked &#7776;r&#299; Weligama
of Ceylon whether there existed anywhere Mah&#257;tmas,
who elevated in this way above humanity, possessed
larger powers and more profound insight than any
other living philosophers? Weligama answered, &lsquo;No!
such do not exist; you would seek them vainly in this
island, or in Tibet, or in Siam, or in China. It is true, O
my friend, that if we had better interpretations of the
Lord Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, we might reach to heights and
depths of power and goodness now quite impossible, but
we have fallen from the old wisdom, and none of us
to-day are so advanced.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I believe that the Psychical Research Society once sent
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
delegates to India who inquired into this subject, and
exposed the absurdity of some of the alleged phenomena.</p>
<p>Curiously in agreement with these extravagant notions
are the beliefs of various uncivilized races. Dr.
Tylor, in his &lsquo;Primitive Culture&rsquo; (i. 440), relates how
the North American Indians and others believe that
their souls quit their bodies during sleep, and go about
hunting, dancing, visiting, etc. It is stated by Mr.
Finn, late H. M. Consul for North Persia, that he never
could induce his Persian servants to awaken him in the
morning. They gave as their reason that the soul
during sleep wanders away from the body, and that
a sleeper will die if awakened before the soul has time
to rejoin the body. The Indian tribes in Central Brazil
have the same belief, so says Dr. Karl von den Steinen
(recently quoted in the <i>Times</i> newspaper).</p>
<p>Furthermore it is clear that the possibility of acquiring
supernatural faculties is not an idea confined to one
country.</p>
<p>Old legends relate how Simon Magus made statues
walk; how he flew in the air; how he lept into the
fire, made bread of stones, changed his shape, assumed
two faces, made the vessels in a house move of themselves
(Colonel Yule&rsquo;s Marco Polo, i. 306).</p>
<p>We are told that the phenomena of European spiritualism
are to be kept distinct from those of Asiatic
occultism. Modern spiritualism, it is said, requires
the intervention of &lsquo;mediums,&rsquo; who neither control nor
understand the manifestations of which they are the
passive instruments; whereas the phenomena of occultism
are the &lsquo;achievements of a conscious living operator,&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
produced on himself by an effort of his own will. According
to Mr. Sinnett, the important point &lsquo;which occultism
brings out is, that the soul of man, while something
enormously subtler and more ethereal and more
lasting than the body, is itself a material body. The
ether that transmits light is held to be material by any
one who holds it to exist at all; but there is a gulf of
difference between it and the thinnest of gases.&rsquo; In
another place he advances an opinion that the spirit is
distinct from the soul. It is the soul of the soul.</p>
<p>And again: &lsquo;The body is the prison of the soul for
ordinary mortals. We can see merely what comes before
its windows; we can take cognisance only of what is
brought within its bars. But the adept has found the
key of his prison, and can emerge from it at pleasure.
It is no longer a prison for him&mdash;merely a dwelling.
He can project his soul out of his body to any place
he pleases with the rapidity of thought<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is perhaps worth noting that many believers
in Asiatic occultism hold that a hitherto unsuspected
force exists in nature called Odic force (is this to be
connected with Psychic force?), and that it is by this
that the levitation of entranced persons is effected.</p>
<p>Others, like the Yog&#299;s, maintain that any one may
lighten his body by swallowing large draughts of
air, and by an effort of will forcing this air to diffuse
itself through every part of the frame. It is alleged
that this phenomenon has been actually witnessed.</p>
<p>The connexion, however, of similar phenomena with
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
feats of conjuring is undeniable. In the Asiatic Monthly
Journal (March, 1829), an account is given of a Br&#257;hman
who poised himself <i>apparently</i> in the air, about four feet
from the ground, for forty minutes, in the presence of the
Governor of Madras. Another juggler sat on three sticks
put together to form a tripod. These were removed,
one by one, and the man remained sitting in the air<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a>.</p>
<p>Long ago Friar Ricold related that &lsquo;a man from India
was said to fly. The truth was that he did walk close
to the surface of the ground without touching it, and
would seem to sit down without any substance to support
him&rsquo; (Colonel Yule&rsquo;s Marco Polo, i. 307).</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is contended, that &lsquo;since we
have attained, in the last half-century, the theory of
evolution, the antiquity of man, the far greater antiquity
of the world itself, the correlation of physical forces, the
conservation of energy, spectrum analysis, photography,
the locomotive engine, electric telegraph, spectroscope,
electric light, and the telephone (to which we may now
add the phonograph), who shall dare to fix a limit to
the capacity of man<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a>?&rsquo; Few will deny altogether the
truth of such a contention, however much they may
dissent from Colonel Olcott&rsquo;s theosophical views.</p>
<p>There may be, of course, latent faculties in humanity
which are at present quite unsuspected, and yet are
capable of development in the future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>According to Sir James Paget, in his recent address
on &lsquo;Scientific Study,&rsquo; many things, now held to be inconceivable
and past man&rsquo;s imagination, are profoundly
and assuredly true, and it will be in the power of
Science to prove them to be so<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a>.</p>
<p>Most persons will assent to these propositions, and
at the same time agree with me when I express my
conviction that mystical Buddhism and Asiatic occultism
are no more likely than modern European spiritualism,
to bear the searching light of true scientific
investigation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the subject of mystical Buddhism ought
not to be brushed aside as unworthy of consideration.
It furnishes, in my opinion, a highly interesting topic
of inquiry, especially in its bearing on the &lsquo;neo-Buddhism,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Theosophy&rsquo; of the present day. At all
events it is clear from what we have advanced in the
present Lecture, that the practices connected with
spiritualism, mesmerism, animal magnetism, telepathy,
clairvoyance, thought-reading<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a>, etc., have their counterparts
in the Yoga system prevalent in India more than
2,000 years ago, and in the practices of mystical Buddhism
prevalent in Tibet and the adjacent countries
for many centuries.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be;
and that which is done is that which shall be done:
and there is no new thing under the sun.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<h2 id="c16">LECTURE XI.
<br /><i>Hierarchical Buddhism, especially as developed in Tibet and Mongolia.</i></h2>
<p>Early Buddhism was, as we have seen, opposed to
all ecclesiastical organization. It had no hierarchy in
the proper sense of that term&mdash;no church, no priests,
no true form of prayer, no religious rites, no ceremonial
observances. It was simply a Brotherhood consisting
of men who had renounced all family ties, all worldly
desires&mdash;even all desire for life&mdash;and were pledged to
devote themselves to meditation, recitation of the Law,
self-restraint, and the accumulation of merit, not for the
sake of saving others, but for their own deliverance.</p>
<p>It was on this account that when the Buddha died
he abstained from appointing a successor, and gave no
directions to his followers as to any particular form of
government. All that he said was, &lsquo;Hold fast to the
Law; look not to any one but yourselves as a refuge.&rsquo;
In short, the Society (Sa&#7749;gha) he left behind was a
simple brotherhood of monks which claimed some kind
of corporate authority for the enforcement of discipline,
but had no Head except the Law. Nor did Buddhism
for a long time think of contravening the last injunctions
of its Founder. Nor has it ever attempted to
establish a universal hierarchy under one Head and
under one central authority, and although the great
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
K&#257;&#7777;yapa as president of the first Council (<a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a>) is
sometimes held to have been the first successor of
Buddha, and &#256;nanda the second (<a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>), these men
never claimed any supremacy like that of Popes. In
point of fact Buddhism simply organized itself in separate
monastic institutions according to local ideas and
necessities. And indeed the exigencies of healthy
growth, and even the simple instinct of self-preservation
compelled the scattered members of the Buddhist
Brotherhood to attempt some such organization very
soon after the death of their Founder. In ancient
times communication was carried on with difficulty,
and the Buddhist Brotherhood could only hold together
by combining for mutual support in various centres,
and adopting some sort of monastic government.</p>
<p>It was thus that every collection of monks naturally
tended to crystallize into a distinct organized society
with certain definite rules.</p>
<p>Naturally, the earliest constitution of each was
moulded according to the family pattern. The living
Head of every monastery was a kind of spiritual
father, while its inmates were his children, and these,
again, resolved themselves into two classes: the first
consisting of the more youthful members of the society;
the second, of those whose more mature experience
entitled them to greater respect and reverence. Then,
again, some kind of pre-eminence was assigned to individuals
who were remarkable for greater knowledge, or
sanctity of character.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand, therefore, how it happened
that the Sa&#7749;gha or collective community of monks was
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
compelled in the end to establish several gradations of
rank and position among its members.</p>
<p>The following were soon recognized:&mdash;1. The &#7776;r&#257;ma&#7751;era
or &lsquo;novice&rsquo; (who began by being a &#262;hela or &lsquo;pupil&rsquo;
under education); 2. The &#7776;rama&#7751;a (also called Bhikshu)
or full monk; 3. The Sthavira or &lsquo;elder,&rsquo; who was
merely superior to others in virtue of his age; 4. The
Mah&#257;-sthavira or &lsquo;great elder&rsquo; (sometimes called Sthavira&#7717;
Sthavir&#257;&#7751;&#257;m); 5. The Up&#257;dhy&#257;ya and &#256;&#263;&#257;rya.
These last were teachers of different kinds, who received
honour in virtue of their knowledge; the two positions
of elder and teacher being frequently united in the
President of particular monasteries.</p>
<p>No doubt gradations of this kind existed in very
early times in India, Ceylon, and Burma. But in India
the whole Buddhistic Order of monks passed away.</p>
<p>In Ceylon and Burma, on the contrary, Buddhism
has held its own. It may even now be found in a
purer form in those countries and in Siam than in any
other region of Eastern Asia, although it must be borne
in mind that, when it was introduced there, it was
grafted on serpent-worship, N&#257;ga-worship<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a>, demon-worship,
and Nath-worship<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a>, with all of which, as well
as with the worship of numerous Hind&#363; gods, it continues
to be adulterated in the present day.</p>
<p>The Sinhalese (Koeppen, i. 207, 386) give a list of
the first five successive enforcers of discipline (viz.
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
Up&#257;li, D&#257;saka, Sonaka, Siggava, and Moggali-putta),
and another list of ten successive Sthaviras or elders,
beginning with S&#257;ri-putta. These lists are untrustworthy,
especially as omitting the great K&#257;&#7777;yapa.</p>
<p>And I may here state that the condition of Buddhism
in Ceylon is a subject which I have had an
opportunity of investigating personally. I visited Ceylon
in 1877, and had many interesting conversations
with intelligent monks, heads of monasteries, and a few
really learned men, including a leading monk named
Suma&#7749;gala, who described himself to me as &lsquo;High
Priest of Adam&rsquo;s Peak<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I found, too, that a lofty idea prevails in Ceylon in
regard to the status of the monkhood. Theoretically, a
true monk is regarded as a kind of inferior Buddha,
and revered accordingly. There are boy-pupils, novices,
and full monks, as in Burma (see <a href="#Page_259">p. 259</a>). The admission-ceremonies
resemble those before described (<a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a>).
Admission confers no priestly powers. Those monks
who are Anglicized by contact with our civilization
call themselves &lsquo;priests,&rsquo; but they are not real priests,
and have no sacerdotal functions except teaching, intoning
the Law, and preaching. They live as celibates
and c&oelig;nobites in P&#257;n-s&#257;l&#257;s (&lsquo;houses made of leaves,&rsquo;
<a href="#Page_430">p. 430</a>), or monastic buildings of the simplest structure.</p>
<p>The number of such monks is said to be about 8,000,
and their chief duties are supposed to be to meditate
a great deal, to perform Ba&#7751;a, that is, to recite the
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
Tri-pi&#7789;aka with its commentary the A&#7789;&#7789;ha-kath&#257; in a
sing-song voice, to repeat constantly the three-refuge
formula (<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>)<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a>, to teach and to preach, to fast and
to make confession to each other on at least four days
in every month, at the four changes of the moon called
Uposatha (or commonly Poya) days (see <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>); these
days being generally in modern times made to coincide
with the Christian Sunday.</p>
<p>True Buddhism does not require monks to perform
public religious services in temples. Nor is it the daily
practice of monks to set the people an example of worshipping
and presenting offerings there. So far as
I was able to observe, the duty of visiting temples
belongs rather to the laity. The monks receive offerings,
rather than present them. As to their dress,
it resembles that represented in the Buddha&rsquo;s images,
and ought to consist of three pieces of cloth stained
yellow or of a dull yellowish colour. The principal
garment is in one piece, but torn and sewn together
again, the object being to reduce its value and assimilate
it to a dress made of rags. The end of the dress
is brought over the left shoulder, and generally so as
to leave the right shoulder bare. In some cases both
shoulders are covered, or the right partially so.</p>
<p>A good deal of care seems to be taken in Ceylon to
instruct the youthful members of the Order in P&#257;li;
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
that is, in the language of their sacred books (<a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>),
and to make them conversant with the sacred texts.</p>
<p>I visited two principal colleges for monks at Kandy,
which enjoy a reputation rather like that of Oxford
and Cambridge in our own country. One is called
M&#257;lwatte, and the other &#256;sg&#299;r&#299;ya. In the former I
noticed a large central hall, in which the ceremony of
admission to the monkhood takes place.</p>
<p>At Colombo there has been recently a revival of
learning, and a modern Oriental College (called Vidyodaya),
for the cultivation of Sansk&#7771;it, P&#257;li, and Sinhalese,
has been established under the superintendence of
the learned Suma&#7749;gala, &lsquo;the High Priest of Adam&rsquo;s
Peak,&rsquo; mentioned before.</p>
<p>Each monastery in Ceylon has a presiding Head, and
generally a temple and library attached, with considerable
property in land, but there is clearly no
organized hierarchy in the proper sense of the term,
and no supreme authority like that of an Archbishop;
though it is said that the Heads of the two Kandy
Colleges exercise a kind of control over the after-career
of the monks they have trained. I found that a certain
amount of intelligence and learning exists among the
monks both at Colombo and Kandy, but it must be
evident to every impartial observer that the habit of
living in houses apart from the laity, of repeating the
Law by rote, and of engaging in a kind of meditation
which generally amounts to thinking about nothing in
particular, must tend, in the majority of instances, to
contract the mind, induce laziness, and give a vacant
and listless expression to the countenance. It may
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
be safely affirmed that the chief religious aim of the
Buddhists of Ceylon is to acquire merit with a view to
&lsquo;better&rsquo; themselves in future states of existence, and
that their highest aspiration is to attain to the heaven
of Indra (&#7776;akra, <a href="#Page_207">p. 207</a>). They have no real desire for
Nirv&#257;&#7751;a (<a href="#Page_141">p. 141</a>), and still less for Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a (<a href="#Page_142">p. 142</a>).</p>
<p>Passing on to Burma we may remark that although
in Burma, as in Ceylon, a pure form of Buddhism has
prevailed ever since its introduction by Buddha-ghosha
(<a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>), and is still existent, yet we find that the purer
system is mixed up, as in Ceylon, with the worship
of N&#257;gas, demons, spirit-gods called Naths (commonly
spelt Nats, <a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>), and with a kind of Shamanism
derived from the surrounding hill-tribes.</p>
<p>In regard to the gradations of the monkhood a more
complete organization exists in Burma than in Ceylon.</p>
<p>To begin with the boy-pupils:&mdash;In Burma nearly
all boys become inmates of monastic houses (called
Kyoung) with the one object of learning to read and
write. They are simply school-boys and nothing more.
Indeed, until our advent, the monasteries monopolized
the education of the country, and to a great extent
do so still. The real gradations are as follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The She&#7749; or Shi&#7749;, that is &#7776;r&#257;ma&#7751;eras or novices.
These are properly youths of at least fifteen years of
age (but see <a href="#Page_307">p. 307</a>); their hair is cut off and yellow
garments are put on for a time.</p>
<p>It should be noted that every male throughout Burma
is required to enter a monastery and become a novice
for a portion of his life, if only for a single Vassa. This
is because the Buddha taught that every true Buddhist
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
ought to conform to his example and become a monk,
although he wisely abstained from imposing any irrevocable
vows. The whole process is often merely formal,
and sometimes only lasts for seven days.</p>
<p>2. The Pyit-se&#7749; or Pyit-si&#7749; (sometimes pronounced
Patzin) or full monks, who have the title Pung&#299; or
Phung&#299; (sometimes spelt Phungee or Phongie), &lsquo;full of
great glory,&rsquo; when they have been at least ten years
members of the order. They correspond to the &#7776;rama&#7751;as,
and are by Europeans called Talapoins (from their
carrying fans of palm leaves). Their dress usually consists
of three pieces of yellow cotton cloth.</p>
<p>3. The Hsay&#257; (always a Phung&#299;) or Head of a separate
monastery, who corresponds to the Abbot of European
countries.</p>
<p>4. The Gai&#7751;-ok or provincial Head, who has a kind
of episcopal jurisdiction over all the monasteries of a
district.</p>
<p>5. The Th&#257;than&#257;-paing (Th&#257;than&#257; = Sansk&#7771;it &#7776;&#257;san&#257;)
or supreme rulers, who correspond to Archbishops.
They superintend all religious affairs. According to
Mr. Scott, there are now eight of them.</p>
<p>Occasionally instances occur of hermit-monks who
lead solitary lives, and sit motionless in meditation for
years.</p>
<p>In Siam the gradations of monkhood are nearly
similar to those in Burma, and we learn from Mr.
Alabaster that the monastic vow is not binding for
life, but can be cancelled at any time. This rule
leads to every Siamese man spending at least three
months of his life in a monastery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>We have now to pass from Ceylon, Burma, and Siam
to Tibet (properly called Bod or Bot or Bhot, Sansk&#7771;it
Bho&#7789;a). And here we leave the simpler forms of
Buddhism and are brought face to face with that
highly developed system which, though nominally resulting
from an expansion of the H&#299;na-y&#257;na, &lsquo;Little
Method,&rsquo; into the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na, &lsquo;Great Method&rsquo; (<a href="#Page_158">p. 158</a>),
was really the product of a still further expansion of the
&lsquo;Great Method&rsquo; and its combination with other creeds.</p>
<p>In truth, Tibetan Buddhism is so different from every
other Buddhistic system that it ought to be treated of
separately in a separate volume, as Koeppen has done.
In his elaborate and excellent work on this subject he
has remarked that for the development of a hierarchy
no circumstance is more favourable than isolation, and
that this advantage was offered in the highest degree
by Tibet. Up to the moment of its conversion to
Buddhism a profound darkness had rested on it. The
inhabitants were ignorant and uncultivated, and their
indigenous religion, sometimes called Bon, consisted
chiefly of magic based on a kind of Shamanism.</p>
<p>To describe exactly what Shamanism is would be no
easy task. The word is said to be of Tungusic origin<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a>,
and to be used as a name for the earliest religion of
Mongolia, Siberia, and other Northern countries.</p>
<p>Perhaps we shall not be far wrong in asserting that
the two principal constituents of Shamanism are the
worship of nature and the dread of spirits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>The inhabitants of Tibet and Mongolia and indeed of
other Northern countries believed that spirits, good
and bad, influenced the whole course of nature. They
held that such spirits were able either to cause or to
avert diseases and disasters, to control the destinies of
men, and even to decide the fate of the lower animals.
Hence it is easy to understand that the chief function
of the Shamans, or wizard-priests, was to exorcise
evil demons, or to propitiate them by sacrifices and
various magical practices. In this way they pretended
to prevent storms, pestilences, and other calamities.
They were supposed, too, to understand omens and to
predict the future by watching the flights of birds, by
examining the shoulder-blades of sheep, and by similar
devices. Shamanism, in fact, with its Tibetan offshoot,
Bon, had much in common with the lowest types of
&#7776;aivism, &#7776;&#257;ktism, and T&#257;ntrism, with which the Buddhism
of Northern India, Nep&#257;l, and the countries bordering
on Tibet, had already become adulterated.</p>
<p>When, therefore, this mixed form of Buddhism advanced
from those countries into Tibet, its approach
was not resisted as an intrusion. On the contrary,
Tibetan Shamanism, although it had possession of the
field, was quite ready to meet the new religion halfway.
The result was an alliance, or rather perhaps an
amalgamation; and this led to the establishment of a
complex religious system which I have ventured to call
L&#257;mism<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>L&#257;mism, then, is a form of Buddhism which, although
based on the H&#299;na-y&#257;na and Mah&#257;-y&#257;na of India, is
combined with Shamanism, &#7776;iva-worship, and magic,
and has a marked individuality and a peculiar hierarchical
organization of its own. This organization has
been compared to that of the Roman Catholic Church.
Doubtless in its great receptivity Buddhism may have
borrowed from Christianity, but L&#257;mism possesses certain
unique features which distinguish it from every
other system in the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately few Europeans have, as yet, penetrated
into Tibet, and its sacred literature has been
little studied. It follows therefore that the various
gradations of the Tibetan hierarchy are not easily described,
and only a general idea of them can be given.</p>
<p>We ought first to note the boy-pupil called Genyen,
sometimes spoken of as Bandi or Bante (= Bandya<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a>,
a term more properly applicable to monks). Boy-pupils
are inmates of every Tibetan monastery; but under
exceptional circumstances a pupil may live with his
parents. He may be received after seven years of age,
and until fifteen, as in Burma (<a href="#Page_259">p. 259</a>). He is placed
under a full monk, who teaches him and makes him
promise to keep the five chief commandments (<a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>).
Though sometimes called a novice he is merely under
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
education, and not necessarily a candidate for the monkhood.
The real degrees of the L&#257;mistic hierarchy, as
explained by Koeppen and others, are as follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. First and lowest in rank comes the novice or
junior monk, called Gethsul (Getzul), who has been
admitted after fifteen years of age to the first stage of
monkhood by a Khanpo L&#257;ma or his representative.
His hair is cut off and he wears the monkish garments,
and has 112 rules to observe. He waits on the full
monk, and assists in all functions except blessing and
consecrating. He has been compared to the deacon of
the European ecclesiastical system, but the comparison
is misleading, as shown at <a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>.</p>
<p>2. Secondly and higher in rank we have the full
monk, called Gelong (or Gelo&#7749;). He corresponds to
the Bhikshu, who has received complete consecration,
and is often called by courtesy a L&#257;ma (see <a href="#fn_121">note, p. 262</a>),
though he has no real right to that title. He is not
properly a priest, yet it is certain that in Tibet he often
discharges sacerdotal functions. The ceremony of admission
to the full monkhood can only be performed
after the twentieth year, and binds the recipient to
253 rules of discipline<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a>.</p>
<p>3. Thirdly we have the <i>superior Gelong</i> or Khanpo
(strictly mKhan po), who has a real right to the further
title L&#257;ma, and from his higher knowledge and sanctity
sometimes becomes a kind of head-teacher (Sansk&#7771;it
Up&#257;dhy&#257;ya or &#256;&#263;&#257;rya).
As the chief monk in a monastery
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
he may be compared to the European Abbot; but
in respect of consecration he is only a Gelong. Nor
are any of the higher grades of monks&mdash;so far as the
forms of consecration are concerned&mdash;higher than Gelongs
and Khanpos.</p>
<p>At this point, however, we have to note the special
peculiarity of the L&#257;mistic system, namely, that some
of the higher Khanpo L&#257;mas are supposed to be living
re-incarnations or re-embodiments of certain canonized
saints and Bodhi-sattvas who differ in rank. These are
called Avat&#257;ra L&#257;mas (see <a href="#Page_190">p. 190</a>), and of such there are
three degrees, which we may denote by the letters
A. B. C. as follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>A. The lowest degree of Avat&#257;ra L&#257;ma. He may
be called an ordinary Khubilghan (from a Mongolian
word&mdash;written by Huc, Hubilghan). He represents
the continuous re-embodiment of an ordinary canonized
saint (<a href="#Page_188">p. 188</a>), or founder of some great monastery.
He is higher by one degree than the Khanpo Abbot,
as presiding over a more important monastery.</p>
<p>B. A higher grade of Avat&#257;ra L&#257;ma called Khutuktu.
He exercises a kind of episcopal jurisdiction over a still
more important monastery than that presided over by
the ordinary incarnated L&#257;ma. He represents the incarnation
of a higher Bodhi-sattva or deified saint, but
he sometimes claims to be an incarnated Buddha.</p>
<p>C. The highest Avat&#257;ra L&#257;ma commonly called a
Supreme or Grand L&#257;ma. He is not an incarnation of
a mere ordinary Bodhi-sattva (<a href="#Page_188">p. 188</a>), but a continuous
re-embodiment of either a supreme Buddha or of his
Bodhi-sattva. The two notable examples of this highest
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
degree are the Dalai and Panchen L&#257;mas, who claim
an authority, like that of a Pope or Archbishop, over
extensive regions outside their own monasteries. They
will be more fully described in the sequel (see <a href="#Page_284">p. 284</a>).</p>
<p>It may be stated generally, therefore, that the L&#257;mistic
hierarchy consists of three lower and three
higher grades. We have, besides, to reckon certain
other distinctions of rank, such as those of the Rab-jampa,
&lsquo;doctor of theology or philosophy,&rsquo; the &#262;horje
(strictly &#262;hos-rje), &lsquo;lord of the faith.&rsquo; These are sometimes
associated with the Khanpo or Abbot, though
slightly inferior in rank to that dignitary. It is said
that the &#262;horje often acts as a kind of coadjutor
Abbot. Practically they rank below the incarnated or
Avat&#257;ra L&#257;mas. Moreover, in every monastery there
are numerous other subordinate officials; for example,
schoolmasters, teachers who explain the Law and guide
the studies of the brotherhood, precentors or choirmasters,
secretaries, collectors of revenue, treasurers,
stewards, overseers, physicians, painters, sculptors,
manufacturers of relics, of amulets, of rosaries, of images,
and in some monasteries-especially those of the Red
sect&mdash;astrologers, fortune-tellers, magicians (&#262;hos-kyong
or &#262;hos-kyo&#7749;), and exorcists. The L&#257;ma is not only
the priest; he is the educator, schoolmaster, physician,
astrologer, architect, sculptor, painter; he is &lsquo;the head,
the heart, the oracle of the laity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is also a whole class of mendicant L&#257;mas, who
have vowed to live a vagabond life for a certain number
of years. They are better known than some others,
for they often find their way into British territory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>When I was staying at D&#257;rj&#299;ling, I encountered
two specimens of the vagabond class who came from
some distant part of Tibet. They called themselves
L&#257;mas, though, of course, they had no real right to
that title. They were clothed in ragged garments
made up of thirty-two patches of different cloths, and
wore thick buskins to protect them from the snows.
Then they carried a kind of knapsack or wallet of
goat-skin behind their backs, and in their hands a
sort of sacred drum or tabour called &#7693;amaru (see
<a href="#Page_384">p. 384</a>).</p>
<p>According to M. Huc, these vagabond L&#257;mas travel
for the sake of travelling. They wander through China,
Manchuria, Southern Mongolia, Kuku N&#363;r, Tibet,
Northern India, and even Turkest&#257;n.</p>
<p>There is scarcely a river which they have not crossed;
a mountain which they have not ascended; a Grand
L&#257;ma before whom they have not prostrated themselves;
a people among whom they have not lived,
and of whom they do not know the manners and
language.</p>
<p>It should be noted that when an incarnated L&#257;ma
is the spiritual Head of a monastery there is generally
a temporal Head to manage its affairs.</p>
<p>Then we must not forget that Tibetan Buddhism
has also its organized female hierarchy, on the highest
steps of which are female Khutuktus and incarnated
Abbesses, as well as lower gradations of nuns and
novices, living together in their own convents.</p>
<p>The rules of discipline for the whole L&#257;mistic
hierarchy fill at least thirteen out of the 108 volumes
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
of the Tibetan Canon (see <a href="#Page_272">p. 272</a>). They do not differ
materially from those of other Buddhist countries.
The 253 rules of the Pratimoksha-s&#363;tra (see <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>)
are said to contain commands and prohibitions relating
to five sides of the monastic life&mdash;conduct, dress, food,
habitation, and occupation.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that early L&#257;mism, like
true Buddhism, had properly no secular priesthood
and encouraged no intercourse with the outer world,
except for the reception of alms and food from the
laity. All grades of the hierarchy were supposed to
live together as one celibate fraternity in monastic
seclusion, apart from mundane associations. Their only
duties were to meditate, recite the Law, and obey
certain strict rules of discipline. This strictness of
discipline, however, was not long borne with equal
patience by the whole fraternity. It soon became
irksome to a large section, and the same state of things
which arose in early Buddhism and generally arises in
all religious communities, occurred in L&#257;mism. The
fraternity of L&#257;mas became split up into two chief
parties or sects&mdash;the strict and the lax. We shall see
in the end that these two sects were distinguished
from each other by the colour of their garments, and
especially of their caps, the former adopting yellow
and calling themselves Gelug pa or Galdan pa, the latter
adopting red (Sham&#257;r). Of course the lax or Red-cap
sect soon infringed the rule in regard to celibacy, and
allowed the marriage of monks under certain conditions,
though such marriages seem at first to have
been exceptional.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>It is said, indeed, that in Nep&#257;l, under modern Gorkha
rule, the celibate occupies a lower position than the
married monk, to whom the services in the temples
are committed. It is said, too, that the L&#257;mas of Sikkim
and other northern countries constantly have children
living with them, though they do not admit them to
be their own (<a href="#Page_152">p. 152</a>). Yet, for all that, celibacy is the
rule, and nominally, at any rate, the great majority of
L&#257;mistic monks in Eastern Asia are unmarried c&oelig;nobites,
who live together in monasteries.</p>
<p>Certainly in no other country in the world are monasteries
so numerous or on so vast a scale as in Tibet
and Mongolia (see <a href="#Page_426">p. 426</a>).</p>
<p>And, indeed, in all probability it was the difficulty
of enforcing discipline and order in these immense establishments,
without some method of securing obedience
to a presiding Head acceptable to all the inmates, that
led to that strange re-incarnation or &lsquo;Avat&#257;ra&rsquo; theory
which is one chief distinguishing feature of L&#257;mism.</p>
<p>The process by which this remarkable theory was
developed is so interesting and so important in relation
to the subject of the present Lecture that it deserves
careful investigation, and to clear the ground we must
here make a brief digression and advert to some circumstances
in the early history of Tibet and Mongolia,
as given in Koeppen&rsquo;s laborious work.</p>
<p>We learn from him that Nya Khri Tsanpo, who
lived in the Yarlung valley, was the first king of Tibet.
After several successors came Srong Tsan Gampo.
This king was born in 617, and, according to a legend,
exhibited at his birth certain marks of perfection
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
like those of Amit&#257;bha or Avalokite&#7777;vara (<a href="#Page_198">p. 198</a>). He
is worshipped as a great Conqueror and Reformer.</p>
<p>In the year 632, or about the time when Muhammad
died in Arabia, he began the work of civilizing his
subjects. To this end he directed his minister Thumi
(or Thonmi) Sambho&#7789;a to proceed to India, and make
himself acquainted with Buddhist writings. This
great man was the first to design the Tibetan alphabet
on the model of the Indian letters then in use (called
La&ntilde;&#263;ha), but rejecting certain consonants and certain
vowels as unsuitable for the representation of Tibetan
sounds, and adding six new letters. Hence he was the
first to introduce the art of writing along with Buddhism
into Tibet.</p>
<p>It may be noted here that Buddhism, to its great
credit, has generally given some sort of literary education
to the barbarous nations to which it has imparted
its own doctrines. It has also made the vernacular
of the people its medium of instruction, though it has
not always translated its sacred literature or ritualistic
formularies into that vernacular.</p>
<p>The first Tibetan author was Thumi Sambho&#7789;a himself,
who is said to have composed a grammar and other
books during his sojourn in India. An important work
translated by him into the vernacular was the Ma&#7751;i
Kambum&mdash;a Tantra work, alleged to have been revealed
by Amit&#257;bha and his son Avalokite&#7777;vara. This book
describes the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet as
well as the origin of the well-known six-syllabled
prayer-formula of Tibet&mdash;Om ma&#7751;i padme H&#363;m (see
pp. <a href="#Page_371">371</a>-374). It contains 100,000 precepts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>The teaching of Thumi Sambho&#7789;a seems to have
been of an orthodox character. He may perhaps be
regarded as the founder of the strict school of Tibetan
Buddhism (already mentioned), which was afterwards
called Kadampa, and finally developed into the
Yellow-robed sect, as distinguished from the Red.
After Thumi Sambho&#7789;a the propagation of Buddhism in
Tibet was chiefly carried on by the two princesses, wives
of King Srong Tsan Gampo, called Dolkar and Doljang.
They were worshipped under the name Dolma, as forms
of the wife of &#7776;iva or of the goddess T&#257;r&#257;; one being
called the white mother, and the other, the dark; representing
the mild and fierce forms of &#7776;iva&rsquo;s consort<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a>.</p>
<p>The first two L&#257;ma monasteries in Tibet (called L&#257;
brang and Ra mo che, founded about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 650; Edgar,
p. 38) were erected at Lh&#257;ssa<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a> by them or in their
honour, and each monastery contained a renowned wonder-working
image, which each princess had brought
with her (see pp. <a href="#Page_440">440</a>, <a href="#Page_441">441</a>, <a href="#Page_492">492</a>).</p>
<p>After King Srong Tsan Gampo, Buddhism declined
in Tibet. One of his successors, named Khri Srong De
Tsan, who was born in 728 <span class="small">A.D.</span> and reigned from 740
to 786, tried to restore it. For this purpose, he sent
for religious teachers in great numbers from India.
These seem to have brought with them a very corrupt
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
form of Buddhism, which aimed chiefly at counteracting
the evil influences of demons by magical spells.</p>
<p>First came &#7776;&#257;nta Rakshita, with twelve companions
from Bengal.</p>
<p>Then the celebrated Padma-sambhava was sent for
out of the land of Udy&#257;na (= Dardist&#257;n)&mdash;west of the
Indus, north of Peshawar&mdash;where the people were addicted
to &#7776;aivism and witchcraft. It was under him
that the great monastery at Sam ye (strictly Sam yas)
was built (see <a href="#Page_448">p. 448</a>). He was celebrated for his skill
in magic, sorcery, and alchemy, and became the real
founder of the Red sect, after instructing several
young Tibetans in his own lore. At the same time
he was remarkable for his knowledge of Indian languages,
and was active in promoting a taste for literature
in Tibet. It redounds much to his credit that he
was the first to further the translation of the whole
Buddhist Canon (almost entirely from Sansk&#7771;it books)
into Tibetan.</p>
<p>But the sacred books had by that time greatly increased,
so that the Tibetan Canon commonly called
Kanjur (or more strictly Kangyur and Ka-gyur, pp. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>, <a href="#Page_267">267</a>)
consisted of at least 108 volumes.</p>
<p>Then we have the Tanjur (Tangyur) consisting of
225 folio volumes of translations, commentaries, and
treatises, corresponding to the A&#7789;&#7789;ha-kath&#257; of Ceylon
(<a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>), and embracing works on all subjects (often
mere translations from the Sansk&#7771;it), such as grammar,
logic, rhetoric, poetry, medicine, astrology, alchemy,
magic, and the use of spells.</p>
<p>A sect called Urgyanpa (or Urgyenpa), another called
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
Brugpa (or Dugpa or Dukpa), another called Sakyapa&mdash;all
belonging to the Red-clothed (in Tibetan, Sham&#257;r)
L&#257;mas who are numerous in Nep&#257;l, Bhut&#257;n, Sikkim,
Lad&#257;k, and in portions of Southern Tibet&mdash;follow the
rules of Padma-sambhava.</p>
<p>After Khri Srong De Tsan came a number of kings
who caused Buddhism to decline; but in the second
half of the eleventh century it began to recover, and
learned men were sent for from Kashmir and India,
one of whom was At&#299;sha (strictly At&#299;&#7777;a), who might be
called the re-founder of L&#257;mism.</p>
<p>He had an eminent Tibetan pupil named Brom Ton
(Brom-sTon or Brom Bakshi<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a>). All violent opposition
to Buddhism then ceased. Monastery after monastery
was founded in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.</p>
<p>Three of the most important were (1) Raseng (or Ra-deng,
strictly Ra sGreng), north-east of Lh&#257;ssa, founded
by Brom Ton in 1058; (2) Sakya (see <a href="#Page_448">p. 448</a>), situated in
the district of Tsang, south-west of Shigatse, and founded
by Koncho Yalpo, whose son was the first Grand L&#257;ma
of this monastery; (3) Brikhung (also written Briku&#7749;
or Brigu&#7749; or Brigung), four days&rsquo; journey north of
Lh&#257;ssa, founded by Koncho Yalpo&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>At&#299;sha belonged to a school which did not favour
&#7776;aivism and sorcery in the way that Padma-sambhava
had done, and his pupil, Brom Ton of the Raseng
monastery, was the founder of the sect called Kadampa<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
which enforced great strictness of monastic life&mdash;a sect
which, as we have already mentioned, had its earliest
origin in the teaching of Thumi Sambho&#7789;a, and whose
tenets were adopted by the celebrated reformer Tsong
Khapa (<a href="#Page_277">p. 277</a>), the real founder of the Yellow sect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the monks of the Sakya monastery
belonged to the more lax school, and were therefore
followers of Padma-sambhava. No doubt these
two chief monasteries of Raseng and Sakya maintained
at first their own separate independence, the presiding
L&#257;ma of each claiming equal authority with the other.
Then in process of time, a rivalry sprang up between
them. Moreover the Brikhung monastery strove with
the Sakya, each trying to acquire predominance. Ultimately
they appealed to the Chinese authorities, who
decided that the highest position belonged to the monastery
of Sakya and to the Red sect.</p>
<p>And here we have to turn for a short time to
Mongolia. That country received its Buddhism, or
rather L&#257;mism, from Tibet. It is well known that the
great Mongol conqueror, Jenghiz Kh&#257;n, conquered
Tibet about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1206<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a>. Before that period the Mongolians
had come in contact with various religious cults;
for example, with Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Isl&#257;m.</p>
<p>They had even had some experience of Christianity;
for Nestorian Missions existed in Central Asia in the
fifth and sixth centuries of our era, and penetrated to
China in the seventh century. All these religions strove
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
to convert the Mongolians, who soon became an important
nation through the conquests of Jenghiz Kh&#257;n.
That conqueror, however, had a very simple religion of
his own. He believed in one God in heaven, and one
king on earth; that is, he believed that God had given
him the dominion of the whole world, and he set himself
to conquer the world. Yet he tolerated all religions.
&lsquo;As the hand,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;has many fingers, so there are
many ways to show men how they may reach heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Khubilai (1259-1294), the greatest of all the descendants
of Jenghiz and Sovereign of a vast empire, was
the first to elevate his people above a mere life of
rapine and plunder; and it struck him that the best
method of civilizing them would be by adopting and
promoting Buddhism, which the greater number of the
races subject to him already professed.</p>
<p>Between the indigenous Shamanism of Northern
countries and the doctrines of Confucius, or of Isl&#257;m,
or of Christianity, there were no points of contact;
whereas Shamanism, as we have seen, had much common
ground with Northern Buddhism, which had
become mixed up with &#7776;aivism and magic.</p>
<p>It was this that led Khubilai to adopt the L&#257;mistic
or Tibetan form of Buddhism. He also thought it wise
to conciliate the spiritual potentates of Tibet, who had
for many centuries taken all real power out of the
hands of their temporal chiefs.</p>
<p>And among L&#257;mistic prelates, the Head of the
Monastery of Sakya and of the Red school in Southern
Tibet had, as we have seen, acquired a kind of
sovereignty. Many monks of this Red sect married,
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
according to the practice of the Br&#257;hmans, and remained
householders till a son and heir was born to them. At
that time they had a presiding monk, called Sakya
Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita, and the Emperor Khubilai appointed Mati-dhvaja,
the Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita&rsquo;s nephew, to succeed him as Head
of the monastery, conferring on him a certain amount
of temporal power and making him a kind of tributary
ruler of Tibet. He was known as the Phaspa (strictly
Phags pa), &lsquo;excellent L&#257;ma,&rsquo; and in return for the supremacy
granted to him, was required to consecrate or
crown the emperors of Mongolia.</p>
<p>Koeppen observes that Khubilai was thus the creator
of the first L&#257;mistic Pope; just as Pepin and Charlemagne
were of the first Christian Pope.</p>
<p>The Mongolians also owe their written character and
literature to Buddhism. It was Phaspa L&#257;ma who
invented the Mongolian alphabet. Taking the Tibetan
alphabet as his model, he invented a square character
with a thousand syllables. He then undertook a new
revision of the Buddhist sacred writings, causing the
Tibetan sacred texts (Kanjur) to be compared with the
Chinese. It is said that this lasted from the year 1285
to 1306.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine learned men, versed in the Tibetan,
Ugrian, Chinese, and Sansk&#7771;it languages, were occupied
on the task of collation, and a few years later, the first
Mongolian translation of the sacred texts was begun by
the Sakya L&#257;ma &#262;hoskyi Odser.</p>
<p>Khubilai, no doubt, was a great promoter of Buddhism,
and founded many monasteries in Mongolia, and a
celebrated one at Peking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>After the elevation of the Phaspa L&#257;ma to quasi-temporal
as well as spiritual sovereignty very little is
known about the state of Buddhism in Tibet, except
that the successive Heads of the Sakya monastery
maintained their position under Khubilai&rsquo;s successors,
and of course perpetuated and extended the doctrines
of the Red school of Buddhism. Probably they resided
at Lh&#257;ssa, and possibly at the Mongolo-Chinese Court.</p>
<p>In 1368, the last Mongol emperor was expelled by
the founder of the Ming dynasty, after Jenghiz&rsquo;s family
had occupied the throne of China for about a century.</p>
<p>The emperors of this dynasty did their best to bring
Tibet under the Chinese Government, and to conciliate
the Tibetan L&#257;mas by gifts, titles, and other favours.
But they thought it politic to prevent the predominance
of any one monastery. Hence they made three other
Heads of monasteries equal in rank to the Sakya L&#257;ma,
and encouraged antagonism between them. This facilitated
the great Reform which L&#257;mism underwent in
the time of the Emperor Jong lo&mdash;a reform brought
about by the celebrated Tsong Khapa, sometimes called
the Luther of L&#257;mistic Buddhism.</p>
<p>Tsong Khapa, whose name is as much celebrated in
Mongolia and Tibet and among the Kalmuk Tartars as
that of the founder of Buddhism, is said to have been
born in the year 1355 or 1357 of our era, in the land of
Amdo, where the celebrated monastery of Kunbum or
Kumbum&mdash;situated North of Tibet on the borders of
China&mdash;now stands. All sorts of legends, but none
worth repeating, are related about him. We may note,
however, a probable tradition that a learned L&#257;ma,
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
&lsquo;with a long nose and bright eyes,&rsquo; who had settled in
the land of Amdo, and may possibly have been a Roman
Catholic priest, became his teacher.</p>
<p>In process of time, Tsong Khapa set out on a journey
from Amdo to Tibet, his object being to acquire a knowledge
of the doctrine from original sources. He is said
to have studied the Law of Buddha at Sakya, Brikhung,
and Lh&#257;ssa. It was in this way that he became impressed
with the necessity of purifying and reforming
the discipline of Tibetan Buddhism, which the Red sect
had corrupted by allowing the marriage of monks and
by laxity in other matters. Innumerable pupils
gathered round him, all of whom adopted, as their
distinguishing mark, the orthodox yellow garments of
primitive Buddhism, and especially the yellow cap (p.
268); while the followers of Padma-sambhava and the
more corrupt school wore red garments and a red cap.</p>
<p>Tsong Khapa soon acquired vast influence, and in
the year 1409 was able to build on a hill about thirty
miles from Lh&#257;ssa, the afterwards celebrated monastery
called Galdan (or Gahdan) of the Yellow school. Of
this Tsong Khapa was the first Abbot. His followers,
however, rapidly became too numerous to be comprehended
within so limited an area. Hence there
arose in the immediate neighbourhood of Lh&#257;ssa, two
other great monasteries, Brepung (also written Dapung,
etc., see <a href="#Page_442">p. 442</a>), founded by Jam-yang &#262;hos-rje, and
Sera &lsquo;the Golden,&rsquo; founded by Byam &#262;hen &#262;hos-rje.</p>
<p>These three monasteries once held 30,000 monks of
the Yellow sect, but now have only 16,500.</p>
<p>Tsong Khapa wrote many works, which enjoy a
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
quasi-canonical authority among the adherents of the
reformed sect. Many of them exist in Mongolian translations,
but they have not yet been fully examined.</p>
<p>Undeniably, Tsong Khapa&rsquo;s chief merit was that he
caused his followers to revert to the purer monastic
discipline, especially to the rule of celibacy. He also
purified the forms of worship, and greatly restricted
without altogether prohibiting the use of magical rites.
Tsong Khapa, too, is said to have re-established the
original practice of retirement for religious meditation
at certain seasons, although as there was no rainy
season in Tibet, another period had to be chosen.</p>
<p>Travellers in Tibet have often described the many
points of resemblance between the Roman Catholic and
L&#257;mistic systems, such as the Popedom, the celibacy of
the priesthood, the worship of saints, confession, fasting,
processions, holy water, bells, rosaries, mitres, croziers,
etc. These resemblances and coincidences will be more
fully noted in a subsequent Lecture (see pp. <a href="#Page_338">338</a>, <a href="#Page_339">339</a>).</p>
<p>It is possible that Tsong Khapa may have imbibed
some of his notions from his instructor at Amdo already
named (<a href="#Page_277">p. 277</a>), who was either a Roman Catholic missionary,
or was familiar with the constitution of the
Romish hierarchy. On the other hand, it is certain
that celibacy, confession, and fasting existed in Buddhism
before the teaching of Christ, and long before that
of Tsong Khapa.</p>
<p>In fact, Tsong Khapa&rsquo;s reformation had been to a
certain extent anticipated, as we have seen, by the
school of Kadampa, founded in the eleventh century,
by At&#299;sha&rsquo;s disciple, Brom Ton (<a href="#Page_273">p. 273</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>Very little more is known about Tsong Khapa. He
died in the year 1419, or, as his disciples believe,
ascended to heaven, and that ascension is still celebrated
during the festival of Lamps by all orthodox Buddhists
of the L&#257;mistic Church (see pp. <a href="#Page_345">345</a>, <a href="#Page_346">346</a>).</p>
<p>When some time after his death, he was canonized,
he was regarded by some as an incarnation of Amit&#257;bha,
or by others of Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;, or by others of Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i
(see <a href="#Page_195">p. 195</a>), or even of the Mah&#257;-k&#257;la form of &#7776;iva,
and his image is generally found in the temples of the
Yellow sect, and often between the two images of the
Dalai L&#257;ma and the Panchen L&#257;ma, on the right and
left respectively.</p>
<p>His followers of the Yellow school called themselves
Gelugpa (or Gelukpa), &lsquo;adherents of virtue&rsquo; (or, Gal-danpa
from their monastery); their principal characteristic
being that they adhered to the purer discipline.</p>
<p>The chief point of interest in connexion with Tsong
Khapa is the bearing of his reformation on the development
of the Avat&#257;ra theory already mentioned (see pp.
190, 265).</p>
<p>It is said that Tsong Khapa himself, like Gautama
Buddha, had two chief pupils, and that he appointed
these two to succeed him with equal authority as Heads
of the orthodox sect. He is also credited with having
been the first to promulgate the doctrine that no election
of successors to his two pupils would at any time be
needed, as each of them on dying would be constantly
re-born in a supernatural manner.</p>
<p>There is, however, no historical foundation for such
a statement. Indeed, according to the opinion of some,
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
the two Grand L&#257;mas were merely the lineal successors
of the two eminent L&#257;mas, At&#299;sha and his pupil Brom
Ton (see <a href="#Page_273">p. 273</a>).</p>
<p>After all, it seems most likely that the whole Avat&#257;ra
theory was an invention of some shrewd Head L&#257;ma,
who, perceiving that the strict enforcement of celibacy
would prevent any hereditary succession, like that possible
in monasteries of the Red school, and foreseeing
that it would be necessary to prevent the suicidal
divisions to which the intrigues of an election to the
Headship of monasteries&mdash;especially of Grand L&#257;ma
monasteries&mdash;would be likely to give rise, bethought
himself of a compromise between hereditary succession
and election. After more than one trial, the system was
found to work so well that it was eventually adopted
with little modification by all Northern Buddhists, and
even by those of the Red sect.</p>
<p>The date of its invention is as uncertain as the name of
the inventor. All that can be said is, that it cannot be
traced back to an earlier period than the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>And here we must again guard against the confusion
of thought likely to arise from the usual practice of
translating Avat&#257;ra by &lsquo;incarnation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We have seen that the doctrine of transmigration
(gati) through various embodiments, as applicable to all
beings, is a fundamental dogma both of Br&#257;hmanism and
of Buddhism, though in Buddhism transmigration properly
means a mere continuous transformation and reconstruction
of the elements (Skandhas) of being (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>).</p>
<p>The idea is very dimly, if at all, adumbrated in the
Mantra portion of the Veda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>It is more clearly traceable in one of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as,
and distinctly enunciated in the &#262;h&#257;ndogya Upanishad
(V. x. 7) thus:&mdash;&lsquo;He whose conduct has been good,
quickly attains to some good embodiment as a Br&#257;hman,
Kshatriya, or Vai&#7777;ya. He whose conduct has been bad,
assumes an inferior embodiment, as a dog, a hog, or a
&#262;a&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la.&rsquo; In Manu the theory is fully developed.</p>
<p>Now it is true that in Buddhism this kind of transmigration
may be described as a continuous series of
incarnations, although genuine Buddhism denies the
separate existence of a soul between each incarnation
(see <a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>).</p>
<p>But the doctrine of repeated incarnations of one
individual in six forms of life is quite distinct from the
Tibetan Avat&#257;ra theory. This theory not only recognizes
the separate existence of an immaterial essence or
soul, but also teaches that the Head L&#257;ma of certain
monasteries is the living, visible embodiment, for the
time being, of the continuous descent (avat&#257;ra) on earth
of a portion of the essence of the canonized Founder of
a monastery or of a celestial Bodhi-sattva or Buddha,
who will perpetually continue to descend from heaven
and re-appear in human forms for the welfare of the
world (see <a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>)<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a>.</p>
<p>A similar idea, we know, prevails in India, where
the doctrine of the descent (avat&#257;ra) of portions of the
essence of Vish&#7751;u and other gods is common. There
is, however, a noteworthy distinction in the Hind&#363;
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
doctrine, because the descents of Vish&#7751;u are not
continuous and uninterrupted (see &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and
Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; pp. 47, 107-116); and although every great
Hind&#363; teacher is supposed to be the embodiment of a
portion of the essence of a deity, each such embodiment
is isolated and single.</p>
<p>And here note that one theory is that the continuous
descents of Bodhi-sattvas and Buddhas into human forms
were effected by means of their third changeable body
(Nirm&#257;&#7751;a-k&#257;ya, <a href="#Page_247">p. 247</a>), which belonged to Bodhi-sattvas
as well as to Buddhas; or, according to another theory,
through rays of light proceeding from the essences of
the Bodhi-sattvas, just as the Bodhi-sattvas themselves
were held by some to have been generated by rays of
light proceeding from the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas.</p>
<p>Or again, the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas might incarnate themselves
not only intermediately through their Dhy&#257;ni-Bodhi-sattvas,
but by the transmission of rays of light
directly from their own essences into a continuous succession
of human beings of pre-eminent sanctity.</p>
<p>Hence it is clear that the Avat&#257;ra L&#257;ma is no
example of the working of either Hind&#363; metempsychosis
or of Buddhist metamorphosis. And indeed,
re-birth, through transmigration and transformation,
according to the ordinary Hind&#363; and Buddhist theories,
is regarded as a kind of natural act, whereas continuous
incarnation through the descent of a portion of a
celestial essence into human bodies is a supernatural act.</p>
<p>Of course, as we have stated, there were lower and
higher Avat&#257;ras, corresponding to the difference in rank
of Saints and Bodhi-sattvas (see pp. <a href="#Page_190">190</a>, <a href="#Page_265">265</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>Examples of the highest Avat&#257;ras are the two quasi-Popes,
or spiritual Kings, who are supreme L&#257;mas of
the Yellow sect&mdash;the one residing at Lh&#257;ssa, and the
other at Tashi Lunpo (Krashi Lunpo), about 100 miles
distant, in a south-westerly direction, not far from the
town of Shigatse (or Shigatze, capital of the province
of Tsang), and not very far from our Indian frontier.</p>
<p>The Grand L&#257;ma at Lh&#257;ssa is the Dalai L&#257;ma, that
is, &lsquo;the Ocean-L&#257;ma, or one whose power and learning are
as great as the ocean;&rsquo; a half Mongolian half Tibetan
title&mdash;Dalai (or Tale) meaning in Mongolian &lsquo;Ocean,&rsquo;
and L&#257;ma meaning in Tibetan &lsquo;a superior Teacher&rsquo;
(see <a href="#fn_121">note, p. 262</a>). He has also the Tibetan title of
rGyamthso Rinpoche (Rin-po-&#263;e), &lsquo;Ocean-Jewel&rsquo; (the
Tibetan equivalent for Dalai being rGyamthso).</p>
<p>The other Grand L&#257;ma who resides in the monastery
of Tashi Lunpo, is known in Europe under the names
of the Tashi L&#257;ma (sometimes written Teshu L&#257;ma) or
Panchen L&#257;ma (called in Mongolian Bogdo L&#257;ma). He
has the Tibetan title of Panchen Rinpoche (Pa&ntilde;-&#263;en
Rin-po-&#263;e), &lsquo;the great Pa&#7751;&#7693;it Jewel&rsquo; (Pan being equivalent
to Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita, and chen meaning great).</p>
<p>Hence Tashi Lunpo is the second metropolis of
L&#257;mism (see <a href="#Page_443">p. 443</a>). It is said to have been built by
Gedun grub pa, the chief pupil of the Reformer Tsong
Khapa, in 1445 (see <a href="#Page_291">p. 291</a>).</p>
<p>Neither of these Grand L&#257;mas are Popes in the European
sense, for neither are elected by a conclave of
chief L&#257;mas.</p>
<p>The belief is that when they quit their bodies at
death, they re-appear after nine months, or occasionally
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
after the second or third year, in children whose bodies
they have occupied from conception.</p>
<p>The Dalai L&#257;mas are held to be continuous re-incarnations
of the Dhy&#257;ni-Bodhisattva Avalokite&#7777;vara
(<a href="#Page_197">p. 197</a>), while the Panchen L&#257;mas are continuous re-incarnations
of his father the Dhy&#257;ni-Buddha Amit&#257;bha
(<a href="#Page_203">p. 203</a>).</p>
<p>Hence, as the father is superior to the son, and the
master to the pupil, the Panchen L&#257;ma at Tashi
Lunpo might reasonably have ranked above the Dalai
L&#257;ma at Lh&#257;ssa. But, as Avalokite&#7777;vara is the special
patron of the L&#257;mistic Church in Tibet, his incarnation
at Lh&#257;ssa is practically a more important personage
than the incarnated Dhy&#257;ni-Buddha at Tashi Lunpo.
Some hold that the Panchen L&#257;ma is only a re-incarnation
of Tsong Khapa, who was identified with Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;.</p>
<p>It is said that the Dalai L&#257;ma exercises secular
authority over about four millions of people, including
monks; although in the present day political power
has to a great extent been taken from him by the
Chinese Government, which has two permanent Commissioners
or Residents (called Ampas) at Lh&#257;ssa, and
sometimes sends a special Envoy (Kin-Tche)<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a>.</p>
<p>The real fact is, that since mere children, who are
too young to have received any education, are elevated
to the Grand L&#257;maship, and most of them either die
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
naturally or are made to die before they have gained any
knowledge, the re-incarnated L&#257;mas are generally unfit
to govern, and in monasteries which have an Avat&#257;ra
Grand L&#257;ma, an elected chief L&#257;ma acts as regent or
administrator of affairs, while the incarnated Buddha
is supposed to lose himself in sublime heights of meditation
and receive divine homage<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a>. This elected Regent
also governs during the intervals of the incarnations,
and at Lh&#257;ssa he is the real Head and most powerful
Tibetan official. He is called Nomun-khan or Nomin-khan
(or No min han).</p>
<p>The manner in which the Avat&#257;ra doctrine is carried
into practice has varied at different times.</p>
<p>It is alleged that formerly the departing L&#257;ma,
before he transferred himself to another body, was in
the habit of revealing where and in what family he
would be re-incarnated. Or occasionally it happened
that children of two or three years of age called out
suddenly, as if impelled by some spiritual influence,
&lsquo;I am a living Buddha, I am the chief L&#257;ma of such
and such a monastery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Or more commonly the sacred books were consulted;
or the official soothsayers gave their opinion.</p>
<p>But the usual rule was that at the death of the
Dalai L&#257;ma the interpretation of the traditions and
oracles about his re-birth and the duty of discovering
the family in which he was to appear were committed
to the Panchen L&#257;ma. When the Panchen L&#257;ma himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
died, the Dalai Grand L&#257;ma did the same service
for him.</p>
<p>It was only natural that the holy land of Tibet, and
especially the holy city of Lh&#257;ssa, should have been
most fruitful in re-incarnations, and should even have
supplied foreign countries with them.</p>
<p>When Messrs. Huc and Gabet were travelling in
Mongolia they were about to pass a certain L&#257;mistic
convent without stopping, when a L&#257;ma came out and
invited them to enter, that they might have an opportunity
of paying adoration to the saint enthroned
within. &lsquo;Our saint,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is not a mere man. In
our small convent we have the happiness to possess a
living Buddha! Two years ago he deigned to descend
from the holy mountains of Tibet, and he is now seven
years old.&rsquo; These living Buddhas, according to M. Huc,
are very numerous. Sometimes a clever L&#257;ma builds
a small temple and attracts a few disciples. Then
by degrees his reputation increases. Other L&#257;mas
build their cells near the temple, and bring it into
fashion, and proclaim him to be a living Buddha.</p>
<p>It is said, indeed, that some spiritual Heads of
the Hierarchy in Lh&#257;ssa have contrived to instal
their illegitimate children in the Headship of distant
L&#257;maseries, so that occasionally the supposed living
Buddha is really the son of some Tibetan Grand
L&#257;ma.</p>
<p>In the present day the Emperor of China exercises
so great an influence in the nomination of both the
Dalai and Panchen L&#257;mas, that the co-operation of
the L&#257;mistic priesthood has become little more than a
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
form. Still the form is gone through, and the following
description (chiefly resting on the authority of Koeppen
and Huc) may give some idea of the whole process.</p>
<p>When the Dalai L&#257;ma dies, or rather when his soul&mdash;which
consists of a portion of the essence of Avalokite&#7777;vara&mdash;has
cast off one body with the object of
entering another, the names of all the male children
born at the time of his death in Tibet have to be sent
in to the great monastery of L&#257; brang at Lh&#257;ssa, and those
parents who have reason to suspect that their children
are re-incarnations, are obliged to notify the fact.</p>
<p>A true decision cannot be arrived at until three
children have been found, or rather (as is practically
the case) until three candidates have been set up for
election who are accepted by the Chinese Government
or its representatives.</p>
<p>The first stage in the process of election is to write
the names of these three children on lots, and place
them in a golden urn. Then the Khutuktus assemble
together in solemn conclave. For six days they remain
in retirement. During all that period they are supposed
to fast and to be engaged in repeating prayers.
On the seventh day, the leading Khutuktu draws a lot,
and the infant or child whose name comes out is proclaimed
Dalai L&#257;ma. The Panchen L&#257;ma and the
representatives of China must be present at the time<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>In a similar manner, the Panchen L&#257;mas, Khutuktus,
and ordinary Avat&#257;ra L&#257;mas are elected.</p>
<p>The Mongolian mode of election is thus described by
M. Huc. (The quotation is not literal, and is abridged.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The election and enthronization of the living Buddhas is extremely
curious. When a Grand L&#257;ma is &lsquo;gone away,&rsquo; that is to say, is dead,
the event is by no means made a matter of mourning in the convent.
There are no tears or regrets, for every one knows that the living
Buddha will soon re-appear. The apparent death is only the commencement
of a new existence, a new link added to a boundless and
uninterrupted chain of successive lives&mdash;a simple palingenesia. While
the saint is in the chrysalis state, his disciples are in the greatest
anxiety, and the grand point is to discover the place where their
master has returned to life. If a rainbow appears, they consider it
as a sign sent to them from their Grand L&#257;ma, to assist them in their
researches.</p>
<p>Every one then goes to prayers, and especially the convent which
has been widowed of its Buddha is incessant in its fastings and
orisons, and a troop of chosen L&#257;mas set out to consult the Churchun
or diviner of hidden things. They relate to him the time, place, and
circumstances under which the rainbow has appeared: and he then,
after reciting some prayers, opens his books of divination, and at length
pronounces his oracle; while the Tartars who have come to consult
him, listen on their knees with the most profound devotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your Grand L&#257;ma,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;has returned to life in Tibet&mdash;at
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
such a place&mdash;in such a family;&rsquo; and when the poor Mongols have
heard the oracle, they return full of joy to their convent, to announce
the happy news. Sometimes the living Buddha announces himself,
at an age when other infants cannot articulate a word; but whether
his place of abode be found by means of the rainbow, or by this
spontaneous revelation, it is always at a considerable distance, and in
a country difficult of access. A grand procession is then made, headed
by the king, or the greatest man in the country, to fetch the young
living Buddha. The Mongols often go through incredible fatigue
and hardships, traverse frightful deserts, and sometimes, after being
plundered by robbers, stripped of everything, and compelled to return,
set out again with undiminished courage. When the living Buddha
is found, however, he is not saluted Grand L&#257;ma without a previous
examination. Doubtless, the simple Mongols are in this matter often
the dupes of those who have an interest in making a Grand L&#257;ma of
the baby. The title of the living Buddha having been confirmed, he
is conducted in triumph to the monastery of which he is to become
Grand L&#257;ma; and as he passes along, the Tartars come in great
troops and prostrate themselves before him, and bring him offerings.
As soon as he arrives at the convent, he is placed on the altar, and
every Tartar, from the highest to the lowest in the land, bows down
before this child. There is no Tartar kingdom which does not possess
one of these living Buddhas; but there is always another Grand
L&#257;ma, chosen among the members of the royal family, with whom the
real government of the convent rests. The famous maxim &lsquo;Le roi
r&egrave;gne et ne gouverne pas&rsquo; has been of old application among the
Tartars. [See note
<a href="#Page_306">p. 306</a> of these Lectures.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that the L&#257;mistic community like
to keep up the fiction of these re-incarnations; and
therefore they pretend to ascertain the genuineness of
every re-birth by clear signs. Hence before a re-born
saint is installed, his identity is established by his
passing a kind of examination before a solemn assembly,
thousands of witnesses being present.</p>
<p>Some of the books, clothes, and sacred or secular
utensils which the dead L&#257;ma was in the habit of
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
using, are brought and mixed with others. The child
is then asked to pick out the true ones, or he has to
answer questions as to the events in his previous state
of existence. If the replies are satisfactory, he is installed
as the re-born L&#257;ma amid great rejoicings.</p>
<p>Koeppen asserts that no positive information as
to the relationship between the Dalai and Panchen
L&#257;mas is forthcoming. Some maintain that both
hierarchical systems developed simultaneously. Some
say that the Panchen L&#257;ma of Tashi Lunpo was the
first Grand Avat&#257;ra Lama, while others hold that the
elevation of the Panchen L&#257;mas took place later, and
only resulted from the increase in importance of the
Tashi Lunpo monastery in which they reside (<a href="#Page_284">p. 284</a>).</p>
<p>The Dalai L&#257;mas may be enumerated as follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>The first is said to have been Gedun grub pa (otherwise
pronounced Gedun dubpa). Probably he was the
nephew and chief pupil of the Reformer Tsong Khapa.
It was he who founded the monastery of Tashi Lunpo
in 1445, and he is by some therefore called the first
L&#257;ma of that monastery. His birth is supposed to have
occurred in 1391 or 1419, and his death in 1473 or 1476.
Then he was born again after ten months as Gedun
GyamThso (or Gedun Yamtso), the second Grand L&#257;ma,
who is held by some to have been the real founder
of the Avat&#257;ra system of perpetual succession by reincarnations.
He filled the Dalai L&#257;ma Chair from
1474 or 1476 to 1540 or 1542.</p>
<p>The third embodiment took place in 1543, and bore
the name Sod nam GyamThso (or Sod nam Yamtso),
&lsquo;sea of virtue.&rsquo; He was the first who really took
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
the half Mongolian title of Dalai L&#257;ma. Moreover, he
laboured hard to spread Buddhism among the Mongolians,
and founded the first Great L&#257;ma&rsquo;s Chair in
Mongolia.</p>
<p>In his fourth re-birth, the Dalai L&#257;ma took the name
of Yon Jan Yam Thso, &lsquo;ocean of merit,&rsquo; and lived up to
his 14th year (until 1602) in Mongolia, when he moved
to Lh&#257;ssa.</p>
<p>The fifth Dalai L&#257;ma was the great Navang Lobsang
(strictly Ngag dBang bLo bSang), &lsquo;wise speaker
or eloquent sage,&rsquo; who is the most celebrated of all.
According to some he was the first real Dalai L&#257;ma,
those who preceded him being merely supreme L&#257;mas
of the Yellow school. His career lasted from 1617 to
1682. He was a kind of L&#257;mistic Innocent. But his
long minority led to political disturbances. In the end,
Navang Lobsang overcame all difficulties, and as a sign
that the power of a king of Tibet had been made
over to him, built on one summit of the triple hill Potala,
where once the royal castle had stood, that palatial
monastery&mdash;that wonderful L&#257;mistic Vatican&mdash;in which
he still resides in his continual re-incarnations (see
<a href="#Page_330">p. 330</a>).</p>
<p>Indeed the successors of Tsong Khapa had good reason
to be satisfied with their position at that time. They
had overshadowed the Red sect, or reduced it to comparative
unimportance. They had won over Mongolia,
which greatly aided them in their struggle for dominion.
Monastery after monastery arose there. The
sacred books had been translated into the Mongolian
language, and thousands of Mongolians came every
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
year with rich presents to worship the re-born L&#257;mas
at Lh&#257;ssa, or sent their sons there for education.</p>
<p>When Navang Lobsang died, his death was concealed
by the Regent, and great intriguing followed.
In the interregnum two Dalai L&#257;mas were successively
set up and deposed. These are not reckoned in the
list of legitimate Dalai L&#257;mas.</p>
<p>Then a child was chosen, who had all the signs of
being called to the L&#257;maship. This was Lobsang
Kalsang Yamthso; he is reckoned the sixth Dalai L&#257;ma.
He died in 1758, after gaining some repute as a writer.</p>
<p>The seventh Dalai L&#257;ma was Lobsang Jampal
(or Champal) Yamthso, who is believed to have died in
either 1805 or 1808.</p>
<p>The next was Lungtog YamThso, who died a mere
infant in 1815 or 1816. He had three child-successors,
who were all killed as minors by the acting Regent.
The last child was made away with in 1837.</p>
<p>If these three children are reckoned, Ge Mure
YamThso must be regarded as the eleventh Dalai
L&#257;ma. He died in 1855. The twelfth was born in
1856, and seems to have lived till 1874.</p>
<p>The discovery of the present Dalai L&#257;ma is thus
related by Sarat Chandra D&#257;s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the death of an incarnate L&#257;ma, his soul is said ordinarily to
remain in the spiritual world for a space (called Bardo) of at least forty-nine
days. In 1875, one year after the demise of the late Dalai L&#257;ma,
Thinle Gya-tsho, the Regency and the College of Cardinals at Lh&#257;ssa
consulted the celebrated oracle of Nachung Chhoskyong about the
re-appearance of the Dalai. The oracle declared that the Grand L&#257;ma
could only be discovered by a monk of the purest morals. Accordingly
the Shar-tse Khanpo of the Galdan monastery, who was well
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
known for his virtuous character and his profound knowledge of the
sacred books, proceeded to Chhoikhor Gya, where he sat in profound
meditation for full seven days. On the night of the last day he saw
a vision, in which a voice from heaven directed him to go and see
a miraculous sight in the Ya-tsho lake of Chhoikhor Gya. Awaking
from his sleep, the Khanpo went to the lake, where in the crystal-like
water he saw the incarnate Grand L&#257;ma sitting in the lap of his
mother and caressed by his father. The house with its furniture was
also visible. All on a sudden this mirage-like appearance disappeared,
and he heard the neighing of a horse. So much of his dream being
fulfilled, he proceeded on the horse to the province of Kong-po, and, on
the way, he happened to call at the house of a rich and respectable family
of the district of Tag-po. Here he recognized the house, the family,
and the child he had seen in the lake, and at once declared that the
real end of his journey was obtained. On his report the Government
officials and the College of Cardinals, headed by the Regent, visited
Tag-po and escorted the infant with its parents in great pomp to
the palace of Rigyal near Lh&#257;ssa. The princely child was only one
year old when he was discovered. He is now ten, and bears the name
of Nag-wang Lo-ssang Thub-dan Gya-tsho, &lsquo;the lord of speech, and
powerful ocean of wisdom.&rsquo; (This extract is abbreviated.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar list of the Panchen L&#257;mas who have reigned
at Tashi Lunpo has not been given. When Mr. Sarat
Chandra D&#257;s was there in August, 1882, the then
Panchen L&#257;ma died from grief (so it was said) because
he had not been allowed to consecrate the young Dalai
L&#257;ma, according to previous custom.</p>
<p>The next important L&#257;ma in great Tibet (after the
Dalai and Panchen L&#257;mas) is the Head L&#257;ma or Khanpo
of the monastery of Galdan (Gahdan)&mdash;the oldest monastery
of the Yellow sect, founded in the year 1409 by
the reformer Tsong Khapa (see <a href="#Page_278">p. 278</a>), who was the
first Abbot. It once had 8,000 inhabitants. The body
of Tsong Khapa is said to be there visible, preserved
from corruption and miraculously poised in the air.
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
Prints of his hands and feet and his bed are also
shown to pilgrims (see <a href="#Page_441">p. 441</a>).</p>
<p>But the Grand L&#257;ma of the Yellow school who comes
next in rank to the Dalai and Panchen L&#257;mas is the
Head of the monastery of Kurun (also written Kuren)
or Urga, in the land of the Khalkhas in Mongolia. His
perpetual re-incarnation began in the sixteenth century.
He is generally called by the Mongolians Maidari or
Gegen Khutuktu, but his proper title is Je Tsun Dampa
(or Tampa) T&#257;ran&#257;tha. A T&#257;ran&#257;tha L&#257;ma (born in
1575) completed a work on Buddhism in the Tibetan
language in 1608 (Markham&rsquo;s Tibet, xlviii).</p>
<p>There is also a celebrated Avat&#257;ra L&#257;ma at Kuku
khotun in Tartary who is a perpetual re-incarnation
of Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299; Khutuktu.</p>
<p>Indeed Mongolia is a kind of paradise in which the
monks of L&#257;mism enjoy perennial bliss, for the Mongolians
are simpler and more full of faith than the Tibetans.</p>
<p>Another Grand L&#257;ma is the Dharma-r&#257;ja of Bhut&#257;n
(<a href="#Page_297">p. 297</a>), and another Great L&#257;ma is at Peking in
China (see <a href="#Page_299">p. 299</a>).</p>
<p>As to Lad&#257;k (the capital of which is Le or Leh), this is
the most western part of Tibet that has adopted L&#257;mism.
A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s mission penetrated to Lad&#257;k, so that the whole
land in king Kanishka&rsquo;s time (that is, in the first century)
was Buddhistic. Moreover, the Buddhist religion
(both Red sect and Yellow) has maintained itself there
until now, while in the neighbouring countries of Kashm&#299;r,
Kafirst&#257;n, the Panj&#257;b, etc., it has been displaced by
Br&#257;hmanism, Isl&#257;m, and &#7776;&#257;ktism, etc. We have little
knowledge of the ancient history of Lad&#257;k. It has
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
a large and ancient monastery at L&#257;ma Yurru, near the
Indus&mdash;in which is an enormous image of the
cloven-headed<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a>
Avalokite&#7777;vara&mdash;another at Hemis, and another
at Hanle. (See Cunningham&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lad&#257;k,&rsquo; Mrs. Bridges&rsquo;
&lsquo;Travels,&rsquo; and <a href="#Page_433">p. 433</a> of this volume.)</p>
<p>In Tangut, all round the blue lake (Kuku N&#363;r),
L&#257;mistic Buddhism has been the established religion
since the end of the ninth century. It seems to have
taken a great start upwards in the succeeding four
centuries, for it was in the province of Amdo, as before
mentioned (<a href="#Page_277">p. 277</a>), that the great Reformer commenced
his career. In the North-eastern corner close to China
is the L&#257;masery of Kunbum (Kumbum), where Tsong
Khapa was born. When his reputation increased, L&#257;mas
from all parts made pilgrimages there. Sarat Chandra
D&#257;s states that it is inhabited by 9,000 L&#257;mas of the
Yellow sect. Koeppen says that it has a University
with four Faculties, and an important printing-press,
and that at the head of it is an incarnated living
Buddha. The L&#257;mas from Amdo are said by Koeppen
to be more highly-gifted, intelligent, learned, and religious
than the monks of other monasteries. They are
intrusted in Lh&#257;ssa with the most important offices, and
are employed in the education of the infant representatives
of Buddha. Amdo is still almost a terra incognita.</p>
<p>Passing on to Nep&#257;l&mdash;this country probably adopted
Buddhism before the beginning of the Christian era.
It is said that A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s missionaries found their way
there; but there is no proof that Buddhism really
flourished in Nep&#257;l till the seventh century, and even
then it never existed except in conjunction with Br&#257;hmanism.
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
It is probable that Buddhist monasteries and
Br&#257;hmanical temples always adjoined each other. Indeed
since the immigration of the Hind&#363;s into Nep&#257;l,
and especially since the invasion of the Gorkhas, there
have always been two nationalities, two languages,
two literatures, two religions in contact with each other.</p>
<p>In recent times Br&#257;hmanism has gained the predominance
as the State-religion, and Buddhism has
degenerated, though it is everywhere tolerated.</p>
<p>It is a question whether the spiritual supremacy of
the Tibetan Grand L&#257;ma has ever been acknowledged
in Nep&#257;l proper. But, according to some, the Dalai
L&#257;ma formerly had a legate or representative in the
largest and oldest Buddhistic temple of Khatmandu&mdash;the
temple of Svayambhu-n&#257;th, who is here at once
&#256;di-Buddha and &#7776;iva. The Dalai L&#257;ma also claimed
the ownership of this temple, which, he maintained,
had been dependent on him from the earliest times.
But it is certain that, even if the Tibetan Legate
ever possessed the authority arrogated by him, he was
compelled by the Gorkhas to abandon his claims.
Nevertheless the Tibetan tribes now in Nep&#257;l still
adhere to Buddhism. The same may be said of the
Newars, who are the original possessors of the great
valley of Nep&#257;l. They profess a kind of Buddhism,
though they reject the L&#257;mas, and have priests of their
own, whom they call Bandya (see <a href="#fn_122">note p. 263</a>).</p>
<p>With regard to Bhut&#257;n (capital town Punakha) it is
said to have become Buddhist about 350 years ago.
Its spiritual ruler and incarnated saint is called Dharma-r&#257;ja
(or L&#257;ma Rinpoche). He belongs to the Red-cap
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">298</span>
school, and calls himself Chief of all the monks of the
Dugpa sect. His subordination to the Dalai L&#257;ma
is little more than nominal. The temporal Governor
is called Depa-r&#257;ja (Deb-r&#257;ja).</p>
<p>The following titles engraved on the Dharma-r&#257;ja&rsquo;s
seal of office will give some idea of his pretensions:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am the Chief of the realm. Defender of the Faith.
Equal to Sarasvat&#299; in learning. Chief of all the
Buddhas. Head-expounder of the &#7776;&#257;stras. Caster
out of devils. Most learned in the holy Laws. An
Avat&#257;r of God. Absolver of sins. Head of the best
of all religions.&rsquo; (See Dr. Wright&rsquo;s Nep&#257;l.)</p>
<p>It is said that there are about 10,000 monks, and
about 50,000 Buddhist lay families in Bhut&#257;n. Many
of the monks do not live in monasteries, but hold offices
under the Government.</p>
<p>Next, as to Sikkim&mdash;of which D&#257;rj&#299;ling, now the
Sanitarium of the Bengal Government, once formed a
part. This is a small boundary country between Bhut&#257;n
and Nep&#257;l. It seems to have adopted Buddhism about
the same time as Bhut&#257;n, or perhaps a century earlier.
The L&#257;mas there belong to the Dugpa Red sect
(<a href="#Page_268">p. 268</a>). The aborigines, called Lepchas, though they
venerate the L&#257;mas, are really only half Buddhists;
and their priests, called Bijna (Bhikshu?) beggars, are
half devil-exorcists. The oldest temple is that of
Pemyangchi (see <a href="#Page_432">p. 432</a>). Next come the important
monasteries of Tassiding, Changachelling, Raklang, and
Tamlung (one residence of the R&#257;ja, the other being at
Chumbi in Tibetan territory). There is also one near
D&#257;rj&#299;ling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>We ought finally to advert briefly to China and
Japan. It is noteworthy that next in rank to the
Mongolian Grand L&#257;ma comes the Head L&#257;ma of the
great monastery of Peking, who represents L&#257;mism in
that country. Koeppen informs us that in China, for
at least six centuries, there have been two classes of
Buddhist monks side by side, viz. first, the Ho-shang
(<a href="#Page_92">p. 92</a>) or Chinese monks, who had become naturalized
in the year 65 after Christ; and, secondly, the L&#257;mas.
These two schools are not distinguished so much by
difference of doctrine and discipline, as by the position
they hold in the empire. The Ho-shang are little more
than separate fraternities of monks, tolerated by the
State. They have no hierarchical organization, and
no bishops, but each monastery stands independently,
and has no superior except its own Abbot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the L&#257;mas constitute in China
a public organized society, acknowledged to a great
extent and supported by the State, and possessing
certain spiritual and temporal rights over particular
districts. It is said, however, that the L&#257;mistic hierarchy
in China is subordinated to the Government
Committee for foreign affairs.</p>
<p>It is further stated that three great monasteries
situated in or near Peking are exclusively reserved
for the Tibetan and Mongolian L&#257;mas, and that of
the three L&#257;mas who preside over these the chief is
the before-mentioned representative of L&#257;mism at the
Government Court (<a href="#Page_295">p. 295</a>).</p>
<p>In China proper, within the eighteen Provinces, the
number of the L&#257;ma monasteries is said to be small,
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
and these are generally to be found in the Provinces
nearest to Tibet and Mongolia.</p>
<p>As to Japan, it does not appear that the L&#257;mistic
form of Buddhism has penetrated into that country.
In all probability Buddhist writings were introduced
there from Corea about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 552<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a>, but it is certain that
Buddhism did not gain much ascendency in Japan till
the ninth century, and even then was not able to displace
either Shintoism or Confucianism and the worship
of deceased ancestors. In fact, Buddhism commended
itself to the Japanese, as it did to the people of every
country to which it spread by its receptivity; and just
as in Tibet, it adapted itself to the Shamanism which
previously existed there, so in Japan it adopted Shintoism,
and turned some of the Shinto deities into Bodhi-sattvas.
Then followed the inevitable splitting up of
Japanese Buddhism, as of all other religious systems,
through disagreements and divisions; and in the thirteenth
century various sects were developed. As to
these, we need only note that while some sects adopt
the early Atheistic and Agnostic form of Buddhism
with its doctrine of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a, the principal sect called
Shin is decidedly Theistic.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Reed, in his work on Japan (i. 84),
informs us that he met a learned priest named Akamatz
in company with the Archbishop of the Western sect.
This priest&rsquo;s account of the Shin sect coincides with
the information which I myself received from a learned
Japanese priest at Oxford.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>It appears that the members of this sect believe
in Amit&#257;bha Buddha as a Being of infinite light and
goodness, their chief prayer-formula being Namo Amida
(for Amita) Butsu, &lsquo;Reverence to the Infinite Buddha,&rsquo;
that is to Amit&#257;bha<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a>. They place faith in the love
and mercy of Amita Buddha, or rather in his readiness
to receive them into his paradise called Sukh&#257;vat&#299;
(see pp. <a href="#Page_183">183</a>, <a href="#Page_204">204</a>). At the same time they are required
to lead moral lives, and salvation is practically only
obtainable through their own works. The monks are
allowed to marry and to eat flesh and fish.</p>
<p>Their doctrines have many points of contact with
Christianity. The late Mr. Kasawara of Japan, who
belonged to this sect and was highly esteemed by all
who knew him in England, said to a Christian friend
that &lsquo;it gave him great pleasure to meet in the Gospels
many coincidences with the aspirations of his own
Buddhist faith, and that he greatly admired the idea
of the Christ as the concrete expression of the Inscrutable
Essence in its twofold form of infinite Light and
infinite Love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another well known sect called Nichiren was founded
by a celebrated student and teacher named Nichiren.
The Nichirens have been called the Methodists or Revivalists
of Japan. They are very strict, and esteem
the book of the Law as the highest object of veneration.
Their prayer is to the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;Glory
be to the salvation-bringing book of the Law!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>Doubtless Japan once had a peculiar hierarchical
organization of its own, which crumbled away not long
ago, and need not now be described. Even in the
present day each sect may have its leader or Head,
who exercises a kind of episcopal superintendence like
that of a Bishop or Archbishop.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned (<a href="#Page_200">p. 200</a>) that a female
form of Avalokite&#7777;vara is worshipped in Japan and
China as the goddess of mercy. Her name in China
is Kwan-yin, and in Japan Kwan-non; and she is represented
as possessing any number of eyes and arms
up to a thousand, and sometimes three faces.</p>
<p>In concluding this Lecture we may note that Russia
is the only European country to which L&#257;mistic Buddhism
has hitherto penetrated. There are adherents
of the Dalai L&#257;ma among the Burat (Buryad) tribes
on the Baikal Lake, and among the Kalmuks on the
Volga. Koeppen informs us that the chief temple
and monastery of the former is on a lake thirty versts
to the North-west of Selenginsk, and that the presiding
monk is called the Khanpo Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita and claims to be
an Avat&#257;ra L&#257;ma. The Chief L&#257;ma of the latter is
said to be appointed by the Russian Government.</p>
<p>Hierarchical Buddhism naturally leads us on to the
subject of ceremonial Buddhism, which must be reserved
for the next Lecture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<h2 id="c17">LECTURE XII.
<br /><i>Ceremonial and Ritualistic Buddhism.</i></h2>
<p>Having in the last Lecture described the manner
in which hierarchical systems were established in various
Buddhist countries, we are naturally led on to consider
in the present Lecture the development of what may
be called &lsquo;Ceremonial and Ritualistic Buddhism&rsquo;; for
no hierarchy can maintain its hold over the masses
anywhere without the aid of outward manifestations,
rites, ceremonies, and appeals to the senses.</p>
<p>Early Buddhism was, as we have already shown,
vehemently opposed, not only to all sacerdotalism, but
to all merely external ritualistic and ceremonial observances.
It swept away the whole Vedic ritual&mdash;the
whole sacrificial system of the Br&#257;hmans; it rejected all
penitential austerities and painful bodily mortifications;
it denounced every form of superstition, idolatry, and
priestcraft; it maintained that to lead a life of purity
and high morality was better than all the forms and
ceremonies of religion.</p>
<p>But the very vehemence of its opposition tended to
bring about a reaction. Indeed, the history of all
religious movements proves that the teaching of extreme
doctrines of any kind is almost invariably followed
by a Nemesis, though the teacher of them may
himself not live to see it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>At the outset a reformer of the ultra type is sure
to gain adherents by his enthusiasm and earnestness,
as well as by his ardour in condemning abuses, but a
time is almost certain to come when his followers will
themselves lapse into the identical practices which it
was his great object to denounce.</p>
<p>At all events, it is well known that in the present
day the Buddha&rsquo;s followers have invented a mass
of complicated forms and ceremonies wholly out of
keeping and incompatible with the purer and simpler
system which he himself sought to establish.</p>
<p>In point of fact the Buddha in promulgating his
creed did not take into account the impossibility of
eradicating certain deep-seated cravings inherent in
human nature, which every religion aiming at general
acceptance must reckon with and satisfy:&mdash;for example,
the craving for the visible, for the audible, and for
the tangible; the craving for some concrete impersonation
of infinite goodness and power; the craving for
freedom from personal responsibility and for its transference
to a priesthood; the craving for deliverance
from the pains and penalties of sin; the craving for
an infallible guide in all matters of faith and doctrine.</p>
<p>Later Buddhism, on the other hand, set itself to
satisfy these longings&mdash;these ineradicable yearnings
of the human heart. It felt that it could not establish
itself on a firm foundation without hierarchical organizations,
and it could not maintain these without
external forms, ceremonies, and ritual observances. It
therefore turned the simple monastic brotherhood into
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
a caste of priests, and it attracted and gratified the
senses of unthinking multitudes by a great variety of
religious rites, usages, and symbols, many of which are
quite unique, while nearly all are accompanied with
superstitious practices implying an amount of ignorance
and credulity on the part of the people, quite
unparalleled.</p>
<p>This corrupt phase of Buddhism is especially dominant
in Tibet, Mongolia, and Northern countries. In
real truth it might be affirmed of every Buddhist in
Tibet that religious superstition colours all his thoughts,
words, and deeds. It is interwoven with the tissue of
his daily life, and is part and parcel of his worldly occupations.
It is equally part and parcel of the national
life, and enters into every Government transaction. Furthermore,
it is fostered by art and science, and ministered
to by painting and sculpture. Nay, it is stamped
on Nature itself. It is impressed on rocks, stones,
and trees. It finds its way to the summit of snow-clad
mountains, to the recesses of inaccessible ravines,
and to the extremities of remote deserts.</p>
<p>To crown all, it might be affirmed that in Tibet
religious superstition goes on by machinery, quite independently
of the human will. It is kept in continual
activity, night and day, by the flapping of flags, and by
the revolution of innumerable wheels and cylinders,
which are acted on by the forces of wind and water.</p>
<p>It may easily, therefore, be imagined that to give
an exhaustive account of all the ceremonies and superstitious
practices of Tibetan, or, as it may be called,
L&#257;mistic Buddhism, would require the command of
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
unlimited time. They have been treated of by Koeppen
in his second volume, and by Schlagintweit in his
&lsquo;Buddhism in Tibet,&rsquo; and have been illustrated by descriptions
in Huc&rsquo;s travels<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a>, in Markham&rsquo;s account of
the travels of Bogle, Turner, and Manning, and in the
recent narrative of Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s&rsquo; Journey. All
I can attempt is to give a concise account of some of
the chief L&#257;mistic observances, taking the books just
named as my authorities, and adding whatever information
I have been able to collect myself from other
sources, while travelling in Buddhist countries.</p>
<p>We must, however, guard against the notion that
ceremonial observances are confined to Tibet and
Northern regions. They are now more or less prevalent
in Burma and Ceylon, which have adopted much
of the Mah&#257;-y&#257;na system, and to these countries we
must give our first attention. Even the ceremonies
now observed at the reception of novices and monks in
Burma and Ceylon are less simple than the early
admission-forms already described (pp. <a href="#Page_77">77</a>, <a href="#Page_78">78</a>, <a href="#Page_256">256</a>).</p>
<p>Of course every novice has to cut off his hair. He
does this to prove that he is ready to give up the most
beautiful and highly-prized of all his personal ornaments
for the sake of a religious life.</p>
<p>But other forms have to be gone through in the present
day, and I now give an account of the admission-ceremony
of a novice&mdash;as performed in Burma&mdash;based
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
on the description in the third chapter of Shway Yoe&rsquo;s
interesting volume called &lsquo;the Burman<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is well understood that, according to the strict
letter of the law (<a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a> of the present Lectures), a boy
ought not to be admitted to the novitiate until he is
fifteen, but in modern times, the admission often takes
place at twelve or even eleven years of age, the belief
being that until a boy is so admitted he cannot claim
to be more than an animal.</p>
<p>The first point to be noted is that his admission involves
the dropping of his secular name, and the receiving
of another title to mark that it is then possible for
him to escape the suffering of life. As he is sure to
have been a scholar or pupil in a monastery (Kyoung)
before applying to be admitted as a novice, he has
learnt beforehand all the forms of worship and much
that will be required of him during his monastic life;
for instance, that he is to address senior monks in a
particular manner and to wait upon them respectfully;
that he is to walk through the streets keeping his eyes
fixed on the ground, without gazing about, even if he
have to pass a pageant or attractive spectacle of any
kind; that he is to wear his garments in the prescribed
fashion; that he is to eat with moderation and dignity.</p>
<p>On the day appointed for the induction-ceremony,
the young neophyte dresses in his gayest clothes, and
mounted on a pony, passes at a foot&rsquo;s pace through
the town or village. A band of music goes before him,
and all his friends dressed in their best garments,
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">308</span>
follow in a crowd, the young men dancing and singing,
the girls smiling and laughing. Thus he proceeds in
procession to the houses of his relations, to bid them
farewell. Of course the introductory observance is
intended as a kind of dramatic imitation of Gautama
Buddha&rsquo;s celebrated abandonment of his own family
and worldly associates, called the Mah&#257;bhinishkrama&#7751;a,
&lsquo;the great going forth from home&rsquo; (see <a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a> of this
volume). When the round of visits is finished, the
would-be novice turns back with all his companions
to his parents&rsquo; house. There he finds a large number
of persons assembled, and among them the Head of
the monastery, with several of his brother monks.
These are seated on a raised dais in front of which
are the offerings intended for presentation to them,
consisting of fruit, cooked food, yellow cloth, etc.</p>
<p>The monks (&lsquo;Talapoins&rsquo;) seated in a row, carefully
hold up their large fan-like screens to shut
out the female portion of the assemblage from their
view. Portions of the Vinaya (<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a> of this volume)
are then recited, after which the would-be novice is
made to throw off all his fine clothes and bind a piece
of white cloth round his loins. Then his hair is cut
off close, and his head is carefully shaved and washed.
Next he is taken to a bath, and after immersion in
pure water, is brought once more, partially clothed,
before the assembled monks. Prostrating himself three
times before them, he raises his hands in reverence,
and, using the regular P&#257;li form of words, asks to be
admitted to the holy brotherhood. Upon that the
Head of the monastery presents him with the yellow
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
monastic garments. These are duly put on, and the
mendicant&rsquo;s bowl is hung round his neck. The ceremony
concludes by the formal announcement of his
having become a member of the monastery.</p>
<p>The present admission-ceremony in Ceylon appears
to be of a simpler character. In fact it differs little
from the ancient form. Those boys who are destined
for the novitiate usually begin their connexion with
the monastery to which they intend to belong by first
becoming pupils in the monastery-school. The devotion
of the monkhood to the education of mere boys
was perhaps one of the best results of the progress
and development of Buddhism. In monasteries, all
boys may learn to read and write<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a>. There also they
gain some experience of monastic duties and requirements,
so that when the time comes for any pupil to
enter the novitiate, his preparedness is taken for
granted. He merely makes known his intention to
a superior or senior monk. Then having shaved his
head, and undergone the ceremony of bathing, the
applicant, who has furnished himself with the proper
yellow robes, presents them to the superior monk, and
requests to be allowed to receive them again that he
may become a novice. Next, on his reciting the three-refuge
formulary, and the ten prohibitions, he is permitted
to take back the monkish garments and to put
them on. He is then formally admitted, and his admission
announced to the other members of the monastery
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
(Hardy&rsquo;s Eastern Monachism, p. 23). It may be noted
that the monkish garments do not include a head-covering
as in Northern countries.</p>
<p>As to the ceremony of admission to the full
monkhood, it differs so little from the ancient rite (described
at <a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>), that no further description need here
be given.</p>
<p>With regard to the religious services performed in the
monastic institutions of modern times, they are, of course,
a great advance on the simple formularies used in early
days, before the establishment and organization of large
monasteries.</p>
<p>The earlier and purer Buddhism, as we have seen,
had only one religious formula, and that was a simple
expression of veneration for the three jewels&mdash;the
Buddha, his Law, and his Order of Monks (<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>).</p>
<p>Any form of worship was altogether out of place, if
not a mere mockery, when there was no supreme Being
to worship; when the Buddha himself, who never
claimed to be more than a perfected man, had passed
away into non-existence, and when all that he left behind
was the great ideal of his own memory, to be
venerated and imitated.</p>
<p>When, however, monastic establishments were organized
and the doctrine became developed, a great
development of worship took place.</p>
<p>To illustrate this I submit a description of daily life
in a Burmese monastery, based on the information given
by Shway Yoe (<a href="#Page_307">p. 307</a>), and often using his words.</p>
<p>It appears that every monastic community in Burma
is roused a little before daylight by the sound of a big
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
bell, beaten with a wooden mallet. Each monk has
then to rise, rinse out his mouth, wash his hands and
face, arrange his dress (the same in which he has slept
all night) and recite a few formularies, among which is
one to the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;How great a favour has
the Lord Buddha bestowed upon me in manifesting to
me his law, through the observance of which I may
escape the purgatorial penalties of hell and secure
salvation!&rsquo; All the members of the fraternity then
station themselves before the image of the Buddha,
with the Abbot at their head, and the rest of the
brotherhood, full monks, novices and scholars, according
to their order. This done, they proceed to intone the
morning service. At its conclusion each stands before
the Head of the monastery, and pledges himself to observe
during the day all the rules and precepts incumbent
upon him. They then separate&mdash;the pupils and
novices to sweep the floor of the monastery, bring drinking
water, filter it, etc., the more advanced novices and
full monks to tend the sacred trees; the elders to meditate
in solitude on the miseries of life, such meditation
being beyond all other actions meritorious. Some gather
flowers and offer them before the relic-shrine (D&#257;gaba).</p>
<p>Then comes a repast, preceded by a grace to the
effect that the food is eaten to satisfy bodily wants,
not to please the appetite; that garments are used to
cover nakedness, not for vanity; that health is desired
to give strength for the performance of religious worship
and meditation. After the meal, all devote themselves
to study or to teaching. Then arranging themselves
in file, they set out with the Abbot at their
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">312</span>
head to receive their food (not beg). Silently they
move on through the streets, fixing their eyes steadily
on the ground six feet before them, meditating on the
vanity and mutability of all things, and only halting
when a layman emerges from some door to pour his
contribution of rice or fruit or vegetables into their
alms-bowls. The gift received, not a word or a
syllable of thanks is uttered; for is it not the receivers
who confer the favour and not the givers? In this way
they circle back to the monastery.</p>
<p>On their return from their perambulation a portion
of the food is offered to the Buddha, and then all proceed
to eat the remainder, consisting perhaps of cooked rice,
boiled peas, fish, cocoa-nut cakes, cucumbers, or even
curried flesh and fowl, usually wrapped separately in
plantain-leaves. Next the bowls are washed, and a
few hymns are chanted before the Buddha&rsquo;s image.
During the succeeding hour the boy-scholars are allowed
to play about, while the monks pass their time in conversation,
and the Abbot receives people who come to
pay their respects. All visitors prostrate themselves
before him three times, once for the Buddha, once for
the Law, and once for the Monkhood. The Abbot in
return says: &lsquo;May the supporter&rsquo; (so he calls all laymen;
compare <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>), &lsquo;as a reward for merit, be freed
from the three calamities (of war, pestilence, and
famine)!&rsquo; At about half-past eleven the last regular
meal of the day is eaten. Monks are forbidden to eat
after noon. When the mid-day meal is over, all return
to work. Some undertake the teaching of the boy-scholars.
Others read the texts of the Tri-pi&#7789;aka with
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
their commentaries, or superintend the writers who are
copying manuscripts. Some of the older members of
the monastery talk with the idlers, who are to be found
lounging about the precincts, and some sink into deep
meditation, which probably ends in deep sleep.</p>
<p>Yet this profound meditation is believed to be all important,
for is it not the path to Arhatship, to Nirv&#257;&#7751;a,
and to the acquisition of supernatural faculties (see p.
245)? Other monks tell the beads of their rosaries
and repeat the prescribed formularies, such as: &lsquo;All is
changeful, all is sorrowful, all is unreal,&rsquo; followed by
invocations to the three holies (see <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>). Between
three and four o&rsquo;clock the lessons are finished, and the
scholars perform any domestic duties required in the
monastery. This is the chief return for the teaching
they receive. Then most of the pupils go to their own
homes for dinner. As to the youthful novices or junior
monks, these are all obliged to fast like the full monks.
Many of them go out with some of the senior monks
for a solemn walk. Then at sunset the far-reaching
notes of the bell summon the walkers back to the
monastery. All must be within the walls before the
sun goes down. The day&rsquo;s duties now draw to a close.
The boy-pupils are made to repeat all they have learned
during the day, and some of the P&#257;li rituals are chanted
&lsquo;with spasmodic energy.&rsquo; At half-past eight or nine
there are further recitations before the image of the
Buddha. All assemble, as in the morning, and together
intone the hymns. When the last sound of the chant
has died away, one of the novices stands up and proclaims
the hour, day of the week, day of the month,
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
and number of the year. Then all bow before the
Buddha&rsquo;s image, and thrice before the Head of the
monastery, and retire to rest (see Shway Yoe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Burman&rsquo;).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that severe asceticism and painful
austerities&mdash;as practised among the Hind&#363;s from the
earliest times up to the present day (described at
pp. <a href="#Page_228">228</a>-230 of this volume)&mdash;form no part of the
duties of Buddhist monks; for Buddhism has never
sanctioned bodily torture, as Br&#257;hmanism has done.</p>
<p>We now pass on to a description of the observances
usual during the period of Vassa (see pp. <a href="#Page_82">82</a>-84).</p>
<p>Mr. Dickson has given us some valuable notes
on the method of keeping this season in Ceylon, and
I venture to found a short narrative on the information
he has communicated<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that the villagers of Ceylon esteem it a
privilege and a work of great merit to send for one or
two monk-priests from a monastery and to minister to
their wants, as well as listen to their preaching and
recitations during Vassa.</p>
<p>The season begins on the fifteenth day of the eighth
month; that is, on the day of full moon in the month
Ash&#257;&#7693;ha (June, July). Sometimes two or three villages
join in inviting a monk-priest to live with them
for the whole three months. They prepare a chamber
for his sleeping accommodation, a room for his meals,
a temporary chapel for the reception of the Buddha&rsquo;s
image, of the relic-casket and of the sacred books, and
a place in which he can recite the law and explain it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">315</div>
<p>On the first day of Vassa the villagers put on their
holiday dresses, and set off with music, dancers, singers,
and flags for the monastery, where the priest, whom
they desire to invite, resides. Thence they conduct
him in procession to their homes. His first act, after
his arrival, is to set up the image and arrange the relic-casket
and books. An altar is placed in front of the
image, and on this the people proceed to make their
offerings of flowers and perfumes. Next every villager
contributes something for the priest&rsquo;s food, such as tea,
sugar, honeycomb, orange-juice, and the like. The
priest, in return, pronounces a benediction, and says:&mdash;&lsquo;By
virtue of this first offering made for the sake of the
Buddha, who is like unto the sun of gods and men, and
by virtue of this second offering made to the monkhood,
which is like a field of merit, may you henceforth be
delivered from the evils of birth in the place of torment,
in the world of beasts, in the world of ghosts, and in
the world of demons, and inherit the bliss of those who
ascend and descend through the worlds of gods till you
are born again in the world of men (see <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>)!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the monk-priest proceeds to the preaching-chamber,
in the middle of which is a chair with a
cushion. He takes his seat, and, holding a screen before
his face to prevent his attention being distracted, commences
his recitations. The people sit on the floor&mdash;the
men on one side, the women and children on the
other. First he repeats the three-refuge formula (<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>)
and the five prohibitions (<a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>), the people repeating
after him. Next he recites some favourite passage
from the discourses of Buddha, the one generally
<span class="pb" id="Page_316">316</span>
selected being the Nidhi-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a Sutta (see <a href="#Page_129">p. 129</a>).
If any listener interposes a remark, or hints that he
does not understand, the priest explains the meaning.
The people then make obeisance and depart.</p>
<p>The monk-priest next repeats to himself the appointed
Pirit for the first day of Vassa&mdash;namely, the
Ma&#7749;gala-sutta, Ratna-sutta, and Kara&#7751;&#299;ya-metta-sutta
(see <a href="#Page_318">p. 318</a>), after which he retires to rest for a few hours.
Rising before daybreak, he meditates on the virtues of
Buddha, on goodwill towards all living beings, on the
impurities of the body, and on death, walking up and
down in his own chamber, or in any place suitable for
perambulation. Next he goes to the temporary chapel,
and prostrating himself before the shrine, says, &lsquo;I worship
continually all the relic-shrines, the sacred Bodhi-tree,
and the images of Buddha. I reverence the three
jewels&rsquo; (see <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>). He then arranges his offering
of flowers, and places these with a small portion of his
morning meal on the altar. His meal being concluded,
he teaches the children of the villagers, or he prepares
for the mid-day and evening preaching (ba&#7751;a).</p>
<p>These preachings are generally well attended, especially
on the four Poya days (<a href="#Page_257">p. 257</a>). On the new-moon
and full-moon days, the priest must go to the nearest
monastery and join in the P&#257;timokkha (see <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>); and
on the full-moon day, which terminates the three months
of Vassa, he must go there again as before, but on that
occasion, addressing the assembled monks, he must
say:&mdash;&lsquo;Venerable Sirs, I have duly finished the Vassa;
if you have any doubt about it, speak, and tell me in
what I have erred.&rsquo; If no one speaks he is held to have
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
fulfilled his duties faultlessly. Then returning and
taking with him a second priest, the two together perform
the R&#257;tri-ba&#7751;a or mid-night service, which concludes
the ceremonies of Vassa. Two pulpits, made of
four upright posts, supporting small platforms, are
erected, and the people from the neighbouring villages,
dressed in their holiday attire, attend in large numbers.
These nocturnal recitations are commonly continued for
about five hours.</p>
<p>Some account should next be given of the ceremony
called Pirit, which is performed in Ceylon and Burma
during Vassa, and also at other times. The name
Pirit is corrupted from the P&#257;li <i>paritta</i>, which again
is supposed to be connected with Sansk&#7771;it paritr&#257; or
paritr&#257;&#7751;a, &lsquo;protection<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a>.&rsquo; We must premise that this
ceremony had its origin in the fear of evil spirits
and demons everywhere prevalent in the East (see
<a href="#Page_218">p. 218</a>); but it must be borne in mind that Buddhism
recognizes no order of beings, called demons, created
by God, and eternally separate in nature from men.</p>
<p>Demons are beings who are regarded as created
by men, rather than by God; for they may have been
men in their last state of existence and may become
men again (see <a href="#Page_122">p. 122</a>). They are, however, represented
as cherishing spiteful and malevolent feelings
against the superior race to which they once belonged;
and all kinds of safeguards and counteracting influences
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
are thought to be needed to protect human beings from
their malignity.</p>
<p>This is quite in keeping with the Hind&#363; theory,
which holds that when a man addicted to any particular
vice dies, his evil nature never dies, but assumes
another personality and lives after him as a demon.
And this applies equally to women, so that the resulting
demons may be of either sex, and the female
is held to be more spiteful than the male.</p>
<p>The most effective of all safeguards against the
machinations of such malignant beings, is believed to
be the recitation or intoning of the Buddha&rsquo;s Law,
and especially of the Sutta (S&#363;tra) division of it already
described (<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>). And of this division there
are choice portions&mdash;twenty-nine in number<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a>&mdash;supposed
to possess greater prophylactic potency than other
portions. Collectively, they constitute what is called
the Pirit, and of these, three are most commonly recited:&mdash;the
Ma&#7749;gala-sutta, the Ratna-sutta, and the
Kara&#7751;&#299;ya-metta-sutta. Part of the first of these has
been already given (at <a href="#Page_129">p. 129</a> of this volume).</p>
<p>Part of the second or &lsquo;Jewel&rsquo; Sutta (translated by
Childers) runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;All spirits here assembled,&mdash;those of earth and those of air,&mdash;let
all such be joyful; let them listen attentively to my words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Therefore hear me, O ye spirits; be friendly to the race of men;
for day and night they bring you their offerings, therefore keep
diligent watch over them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>&lsquo;Whatsoever treasure exists here or in other worlds, whatsoever
glorious jewels in the heavens, there is none like Buddha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Buddha is this glorious jewel. May this truth bring prosperity!
There is nought like this doctrine. The Law is this glorious jewel.
May this truth bring prosperity!</p>
<p>&lsquo;The disciples of Buddha, worthy to receive gifts, the priesthood is
this glorious jewel. May this truth bring prosperity!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Their old karma is destroyed, no new karma is produced. Their
hearts no longer cleaving to future life, their seed of existence destroyed,
their desires quenched, the righteous are extinguished like
this lamp. The priesthood is this glorious jewel. May this truth
bring prosperity! Ye spirits here assembled&mdash;those of earth and those
of air&mdash;let us bow before Buddha&mdash;let us bow before the Law&mdash;let us
bow before the Monkhood.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of the third or Kara&#7751;&#299;ya-metta-sutta runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what should be done by him who is wise in seeking his own
good. Contented and cheerful, not oppressed with the cares of this
world, not burdened with riches, tranquil, discreet, not arrogant, not
greedy for gifts, let him not do any mean action for which others who
are wise might reprove him. Let all creatures be happy and prosperous;
let them be of joyful mind. Let no man in any place deceive another,
nor let him be harsh towards any one; let him not, out of anger or
resentment, wish ill to his neighbour. As a mother, so long as she lives,
watches over her child, her only child, so among all beings let boundless
goodwill prevail. Let goodwill without measure, impartial, unmixed
with enmity, prevail throughout the world, above, below, around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rev. D. J. Gogerley witnessed the performance
of a great Pirit ceremony in Ceylon (Hardy&rsquo;s Monachism,
p. 240). Taking his account and that of Mr.
Dickson, I have compiled the following brief description
of the Mah&#257;-ba&#7751;a Pirit, &lsquo;great Pirit recitation&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>So soon as the sun has set crowds of people arrive
at the Recitation-Hall, bringing oil-lamps made out
of cocoanut-shells. The Hall is decorated, and a canopy,
shaped like a pagoda, is erected over the pulpits, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">320</span>
are placed on a raised platform. When darkness
supervenes a blaze of light illuminates the Hall. A
relic of the Buddha is deposited on the platform, and
a sacred thread is fastened round the Hall, one extremity
of it being brought close to the relic and to
the Reciters. On the morning of the next day, the
recitations begin. One of the Reciters repeats the
three-refuge formula, and the five commandments (see
pp. <a href="#Page_78">78</a>, <a href="#Page_126">126</a>). Then incense is burnt round the platform,
and the musicians outside the Hall strike up
a lively air. Next, the formula of &lsquo;the twelve successive
causes of existence&rsquo; (see <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>) is intoned, and
a hymn of victory chanted.</p>
<p>The recitation of the Pirit continues uninterruptedly,
day and night, for seven days. Twenty-four priests
are employed, two of whom are constantly seated on
the platform and engaged in reciting. Moreover three
times in each day&mdash;at sunrise, mid-day, and sunset&mdash;they
all assemble together and chant in chorus. Of
course, when the recitation of the Suttas constituting
the Pirit is concluded, it is recommenced, and in this
way all the Suttas are recited again and again. On
the morning of the seventh day a messenger is sent
to a neighbouring temple to invite the attendance of
the gods. Then by a stretch of the imagination certain
of the gods and spirits are believed to answer the
summons, and on their supposed arrival, the protective
Suttas are chanted more energetically than ever till
the morning of the eighth day, when a benediction
concludes the ceremony, and offerings of robes are made
to the priest-reciters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_321">321</div>
<p>We now pass on to Tibet and Mongolia.</p>
<p>The ceremonies of admission to the monkhood in
those countries do not deviate sufficiently from the
practices just described to require special notice.</p>
<p>With regard, however, to the dress of L&#257;mistic
monks after their admission to the Order, the ancient
rule, as we have seen, obliged them to wear only three
garments of a dirty yellowish colour, made out of rags,
or picked up in cemeteries or on dust heaps. But the
necessities of a colder climate have compelled the
L&#257;mas to increase their official vestments, and the
higher L&#257;mas sometimes wear bright silken robes enriched
with ornament. The law is sufficiently obeyed
by putting a patch or two at one corner.</p>
<p>A full equipment is supposed to consist of an under
vestment, a sort of tunic worn over it, a mantle, a kind
of scarf worn over the left shoulder, a loose robe brought
round over the same shoulder, and a cap<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a>. The right
shoulder is rarely bare, as it generally is in Southern
Buddhist countries.</p>
<p>The colour of these six articles of clothing, especially
of the cap, is yellow or red, according to the sect to
which a monk belongs.</p>
<p>The cap is an important mark of sectarian difference,
and is of various forms, and when it has five points,
has been compared to a bishop&rsquo;s mitre, but the five
points really denote the five Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas and their
Bodhi-sattvas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>Part of every full monk&rsquo;s equipment in Tibet is a
peculiar instrument, made of bronze or other metal,
and called a Dorje (Sansk&#7771;it Vajra, &lsquo;a thunderbolt&rsquo;),
the employment of which for religious objects is
peculiar to Northern Buddhism. It is shaped like
the imaginary thunderbolt of the gods Indra and
&#7776;iva&mdash;that is, it consists of a short bar, about four
inches long, the two extremities of which swell out
in globular form, or like small oval cages formed of
hoops of metal. The original Dorje is supposed to
have fallen direct from Indra&rsquo;s heaven, and to have been
preserved in a monastery near Lh&#257;ssa, called Sera
pp. <a href="#Page_278">278</a>, <a href="#Page_442">442</a>. According to another legend, the original
instrument belonged to Gautama Buddha himself, and
on his passing away into non-existence, transported
itself through the air from India into Tibet. The
consecrated imitations of it are innumerable. Their
primary use is for exorcising and driving away evil
spirits, especially in the performance of ceremonies
and repetition of prayers&mdash;the instrument being then
held between the fingers and thumb and waved backwards
and forwards, or from side to side.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the Dorje in securing good fortune
and warding off evil influences of all kinds is supposed
to be of wide application. The idea was really borrowed
from &#7776;aivism or from the Tantra system, introduced
through Nep&#257;l by the Red sect. It is easy to understand
the enormous power supposed to belong
to a priesthood which claimed to be the wielders of a
formidable thunderbolt, sent to them directly from
heaven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<p>No wonder that the original Dorje preserved at the
Sera monastery has become an object of actual worship.
According to M. Huc, countless pilgrims prostrate themselves
before it; and at the New Year&rsquo;s festival, on the
27th day of the first month, it is carried in procession
with great pomp to Lh&#257;ssa,&mdash;to the two centres of
L&#257;mism&mdash;Potala and L&#257; brang. On its way there, the
mystical implement is adored by the whole population,
male and female (ii. 221).</p>
<p>Below is an engraving of a Dorje which I brought
from D&#257;rj&#299;ling.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/i323.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="154" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>It should be mentioned that the fierce Bodhi-sattva
Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i (see <a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a> of this volume) is represented
holding a similar Dorje in his right hand in his character
of subduer of evil spirits. In some representations
the evil demons are denoted by serpents.</p>
<p>Another important part of a full monk&rsquo;s equipment in
Tibet is the Prayer-bell (called Drilbu) employed at the
performance of daily religious ceremonies, and rung to
accompany the repetition and chanting of prayers, or
to fill up the intervals of worship. It often has half
a Dorje as a handle, or the handle is ornamented with
various mystical symbols carved on it. The object of
ringing bells during worship is to call the attention of
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
the beings who are worshipped, or to keep off evil
spirits by combining noise with the waving of the
Dorje in the handle.</p>
<p>The bell here represented was brought by me from
D&#257;rj&#299;ling.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/i324.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="757" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>The bells used in Burma are described at <a href="#Page_526">p. 526</a>.</p>
<p>Other religious implements used by novices and lay-brethren,
as well as by full monks, are prayer-wheels,
prayer-cylinders, rosaries, amulets (see <a href="#Page_358">p. 358</a>), drums
(see <a href="#Page_385">p. 385</a>), and the Phurbu or Phur-pa (pp. <a href="#Page_351">351</a>, <a href="#Page_352">352</a>).</p>
<p>As to the daily religious services and ceremonies performed
by Monks in Tibet and Mongolia, these, of
course, are far more ritualistic than in southern Buddhist
countries. It has already been explained (at
pp. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>, <a href="#Page_225">225</a>) that certain abstract essences or mystical
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">325</span>
forms of the Buddha, called Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas, were imagined
to exist, and these had their concrete energizing
vice-gerents called Bodhi-sattvas&mdash;beings who received
adoration as if they were actually gods. In Tibet the
Bodhi-sattva Avalokite&#7777;vara, and the canonized reformer
Tsong Khapa, and other supposed saints, became
prominent objects of religious worship. Then, in process
of time, a complicated ceremonial was developed,
which, as we shall see (<a href="#Page_338">p. 338</a>), has much in common
with the ritual of Roman Catholic Christianity.</p>
<p>The language employed in the religious services of
the L&#257;mistic Hierarchy, whether in Tibet, Mongolia, or
in the L&#257;ma monasteries of China and Manchuria, is
Tibetan. In fact, Tibetan is to the L&#257;mistic Church
what Latin is to the Romish. It is the sole orthodox
language of religion and religious ceremonial.</p>
<p>According to Koeppen, only one Mongolian L&#257;ma-monastery
(and that established at Peking) has the
right to perform religious services in Mongolian instead
of in Tibetan<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Edkins, however, states that there is a temple
(called Fa-hai-si) near the hunting-park, in which the
Manchu language is employed instead of Tibetan.
(Chinese Buddhism, p. 406.)</p>
<p>Without doubt the acquisition of some knowledge of
the Tibetan language is incumbent on every L&#257;ma.
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">326</span>
Nevertheless, few, except in Tibet, really understand it.
They simply repeat the usual prayers and formularies
mechanically<a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_327">327</div>
<p>It appears that the L&#257;mistic priests assemble three
times a day to go through the prescribed ritual&mdash;at
sunrise, at mid-day, and at sunset. We read that,
before commencing the service, they enter the temple
or hall of worship in procession and seat themselves on
low seats in long rows. These are placed the whole
length of the hall, from the entrance-door to the altar,
being divided in the middle by a passage. At the
further extremity, close to the altar, are two raised
thrones for the Head L&#257;mas&mdash;a five-cushioned one on
the right for the Abbot and a three-cushioned one for
the Vice-Abbot.</p>
<p>When all have seated themselves, the choir-master or
precentor gives a signal with a bell. Then the prayer-formularies
are recited or chanted, certain passages out
of the Law are intoned and certain litanies sung,
sometimes in loud tones, accompanied by noisy music
or by clapping of hands, and generally in unison,
though occasionally verses are sung alternately with
responses.</p>
<p>Then at other times a sentence of the Law is
repeated by each monk in turn; or a chant is set up
consisting of such words as: Praise be to the Buddha!
or praise be to some Bodhi-sattva! followed by a recital
of all his names, titles, and epithets; or mystical
sentences and syllables are ejaculated. The result is
said to be a chaos of voices and a deafening confusion
of sounds.</p>
<p>The chief instruments used in the services are a
spiral shell, a long trumpet of copper or brass
(sometimes more than ten feet long), a large drum,
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
flutes, cymbals, and horns&mdash;the last being sometimes
made of the thigh-bones of human beings<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a>.</p>
<p>The ritual is imposing, and still more so when a
living Buddha is present. It has been described by
M. Huc, and I here give the substance of his account<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In front of the chief idol, and on a level with the altar, is a gilded
seat for the living Buddha or Grand L&#257;ma of the Monastery. The
whole space of the temple, from one end to the other, is occupied by
long low seats almost level with the ground, stretching right and
left of the Grand L&#257;ma&rsquo;s throne. These are covered with carpets,
a vacant space being left between each row for the L&#257;mas to pass and
repass. When the hour of prayer is come, a L&#257;ma, whose office it is
to summon the choir, places himself in front of the grand entrance
of the temple and blows with all the force of his lungs into a conch-shell
trumpet, the sound of which is audible for a league round. This
effectually rouses the L&#257;mas and calls them together. Each then takes
his mantle and official hat of ceremony, and repairs to the interior
court. The trumpet sounds again, and when its note is heard for the
third time, the great door is suddenly thrown open; the living Buddha
enters, and takes his seat in front of the image on the altar. Then the
L&#257;mas, after depositing their red boots in the vestibule, advance
towards him barefoot, and adore him by three prostrations. This done,
they seat themselves on the long seats according to their dignity,
cross-legged and face to face. As soon as the director of the ceremonies
has given the signal by tinkling a little bell, everyone murmurs
the prescribed prayers, unrolling the formularies on his knees. After
this recitation, there is profound silence for a minute. Then the
bell is again rung, and a hymn or chant in two choruses begins. The
Tibetan prayers, ordinarily arranged in verses, and written in
metrical style, are well adapted to harmony; but sometimes at certain
pauses indicated by the rubric, the L&#257;ma musicians execute a strain
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">329</span>
in little accord with the gravity of the psalmody. The result is a
stunning noise of bells, cymbals, drums, tambourines, conch-shells,
trumpets, and pipes. Each musician sounds his instrument with a
sort of fury, and each strives to outdo his neighbour in the noise he
can produce. (Huc&rsquo;s Travels, i. 88, abridged.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One important element in some Tibetan religious
services is the consecration and distribution of holy
water and grain by the chief L&#257;mas.</p>
<p>Perfumes, too, are burnt, and censers containing
incense are swung backwards and forwards during the
ceremonies.</p>
<p>Then, again, some L&#257;mistic ceremonials include the
drinking of tea poured into little cups, kept in the
breast-pockets of the monks&rsquo; robes, and replenished two
or three times during the service.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Temple (Journal, ii. 208) thus describes
a tea-drinking ceremonial at which he was present, at
the monastery of Pemyangchi in Sikkim (see <a href="#Page_298">p. 298</a> of
these Lectures).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The priests and monks, some thirty-five in all, were drawn up in
full robes to receive us. Then the officials of the monastery were
introduced&mdash;the steward, the rod-bearer, the deputy master, and
lastly, the master. A procession was quickly formed, which we
followed into the chapel, where they all took their accustomed seats,
while we sat on places prepared for us. The interior of the chapel
seemed an odd place for this, but we were told that it was the correct
ceremonial. A chant was begun, which lasted some ten minutes, as
a sort of grace, and then tea was handed round&mdash;first to us, next to
the priests, and lastly to the monks. A short chant followed, and
then the procession preceded us out of the chapel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the picture which accompanies Sir Richard&rsquo;s
description, all the monks have head-coverings, some
of which are like caps or hats of a high sugar-loaf
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
shape, while others have several points like episcopal
mitres (see <a href="#Page_321">p. 321</a>).</p>
<p>The monks of Sikkim are generally of the Dugpa
sect<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a>, and wear red caps (see pp. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>, <a href="#Page_298">298</a>).</p>
<p>When Dr. Watt was in Lad&#257;k, he was present at a
service performed by a number of monks belonging to
both sects, who seemed to fraternize very amicably. All
the monks of the red sect took up a position on one
side of the chapel, while those of the yellow sect
ranged themselves on the opposite side. The two
sects entered together, as usual, in procession, and part
of the ceremonial&mdash;as in that witnessed by Sir Richard
Temple&mdash;consisted in drinking tea from little cups
taken from the folds of their robes, and put back again,
to be again taken out and replenished; and this, too,
without interrupting the continuous repetition of
prayers, chants, and formularies<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a>.</p>
<p>M. Huc also describes a &lsquo;Tea-general&rsquo; ceremony after
morning service in a temple. Each monk drinks in
silence, carefully placing his scarf before his cup, as
if to prevent the sight of the apparent incongruity of
drinking tea in such a sacred spot (ii. 57).</p>
<p>Another instance of tea-drinking as an element in
L&#257;mistic ceremonial, occurs in Mr. Sarat Chandra
D&#257;s&rsquo; highly interesting account of the ceremony of
his presentation to the Dalai L&#257;ma at the palace-monastery
of Potala, in Lh&#257;ssa, on June 10, 1882. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">331</span>
venture to give the substance of it in an abbreviated
form and not quite literally<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a>.</p>
<p>An account of other presentations both to the Dalai
L&#257;ma and Tashi L&#257;ma will be given in a future
Lecture (see pp. <a href="#Page_439">439</a>, <a href="#Page_444">444</a>, <a href="#Page_447">447</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early in the morning I was informed of the arrival of Chola Kusho,
who was ready to take me to Potala for presentation to the Dalai
L&#257;ma. We sallied forth on horseback, with three bundles of incense-sticks
in our hands, and a roll of scarves in our breast-pockets, chanting
as we went along certain hymns, and particularly the mystic
&lsquo;Om ma&#7751;i padme H&#363;m.&rsquo; In the street we saw a calf sucking milk,
and several women fetching water in our direction. My companions
were delighted at these auspicious omens. Arrived at the eastern
gateway of Potala, we dismounted, and walked up a long hall, on two
sides of which were two rows of prayer-wheels, put there to be
twirled, on going in and coming out.</p>
<p>A young monk now came down to conduct us, and we ascended
slowly, looking only on the ground before us. The several ladders
which conducted us from one story to another were steep, and placed
in dark halls. I counted five, which took us as far as the ground-floor
of the Red palace. Half-a-dozen ladders still remained to be scaled.</p>
<p>At about eight we reached the top, and there found a number of
monks anxiously awaiting an interview with his Holiness. A seat
was pointed out to me. A monk sat near me, and smilingly observed
that it must have been on account of the sins of my former life that
I was born in India, where there is no living Buddha.</p>
<p>From the top of the Red palace we enjoyed a grand panorama of
Lh&#257;ssa and its suburbs. Shortly afterwards some L&#257;mas of high
rank, dressed in loose yellow mantles, arrived. They entered the hall
of reception one after another in solemn array. We remained outside
in anxious suspense, fixing our eyes on the entrance door, and expecting
to be summoned to his Holiness&rsquo; presence.</p>
<p>At last, three L&#257;mas came towards us and asked us to enter in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_332">332</span>
line one after another. Walking very gently, we proceeded to the
middle of the audience hall&mdash;a spacious apartment supported by three
rows of four wooden pillars. The walls had paintings of the exploits
of Buddha, of Chanrassig<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a>, Tsong Khapa, and other celebrated saints,
besides images of the successive incarnations of the Dalai L&#257;ma.</p>
<p>As soon as we had entered the official scarf-collectors received the
presentation-scarves from our hands. We seated ourselves on rugs,
spread in about eight rows, my seat being in the third row, at a
distance of about ten feet from the Grand L&#257;ma&rsquo;s throne, and a little
to his left. When all were seated, perfect silence reigned in the
grand hall. The state officials walked from left to right with serene
gravity, as became their exalted rank, in the presence of the Supreme
Vice-Regent of Buddha on earth. At their head walked the Kuchar
Khanpo, who carried in his hand the bowl of benediction, containing
the sacred Thui (that is, consecrated water stained yellow with saffron)
for sprinkling over the audience. The bearer of the incense-pot, suspended
by three golden chains, the carrier of the royal golden tea-pot,
and other domestic officials, now came up, and stood motionless as
pictures, without looking on either side, but fixing their eyes and their
attention, as it were, on the tips of their respective noses. Two large
golden lamp-burners, resembling flower-vases, flickered on two sides
of the throne. The great altar&mdash;resembling an oriental throne, and
supported by lions<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a> carved in wood&mdash;on which sat his Holiness, a
child of eight, was covered with silk scarves of great value. It was
about four feet high, six long, and four broad. A yellow mitre-hat<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a>
covered the Grand L&#257;ma&rsquo;s head, the pendant portions veiling his ears,
and a yellow mantle enveloped his person. He sat cross-legged, with
the palms of his hands joined together to bless us. When it came to
my turn I received his Holiness&rsquo; benediction, and was able to look
upon his divine face. Other L&#257;mas approached him with downcast
looks, and resumed their respective seats, not presuming to look up.
I longed to linger a few seconds, but other candidates for benediction
displaced me by pushing me gently forward. I noticed that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
princely child possessed a really bright and fair complexion, with rosy
cheeks. His eyes were large and penetrating. The contour of his
face was remarkably &#256;ryan, though somewhat marred by the obliquity
of his eyes. The thinness of his person was probably owing to the
fatigues of the court-ceremonies, religious duties, and ascetic observances,
to which he had been subjected since taking the vows of monkhood.
Remembering the stories about the freaks of fortune, which
had lately brought him to this proud position, and had compelled
his predecessors to undergo untimely transmigrations, I pitied his
exalted rank: for who knows whether he will not be forced to undergo
another transmigration before reaching his twentieth year?</p>
<p>When all were again seated after receiving the Dalai L&#257;ma&rsquo;s benediction,
the Sol-pon Chhenpo poured tea in his Holiness&rsquo; golden cup
from a golden tea-pot, while four assistant Sol-pons poured tea in the
cups of the audience, consisting of the head L&#257;mas of Meru monastery
and ourselves. Before the Grand L&#257;ma lifted his cup to his lips, a
grace was solemnly said, beginning with &lsquo;Om &#257;h H&#363;m&rsquo; thrice chanted,
and followed by a prayer to the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;Never even for a
moment losing sight of the three Holies, always offer reverence to the
Tri-ratnas; let the blessings of the three be upon us.&rsquo; Without even
stirring the air by the movements of our limbs, we slowly lifted our
cups to our lips, and drank the tea&mdash;which was delicious&mdash;taking care
to make no sound with our lips. Three times was tea served, and
three times we emptied our cups, after which we put them back in
our breast-pockets. Then the Sol-pon placed a golden dish full of
consecrated rice in front of his Holiness, which he only touched. The
remainder was distributed among those present. I obtained a handful,
which I carefully tied in one corner of my handkerchief. The
following grace was then uttered by the assembled monks, with much
gravity:&mdash;&lsquo;The most precious <i>Buddha</i> is the most perfect and matchless
teacher; the most unerring guide is the <i>Sa&#7749;gha</i>; the most infallible
protection is in the sacred <i>Dharma</i>. We offer these offerings to these
three objects of refuge. Reverence be to each of them!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s also witnessed at the same
time the performance of a remarkable ceremony for the
translation of the soul of a chief L&#257;ma or Khanpo to
one of the heavenly mansions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_334">334</div>
<p>It appears that a certain well-known Khanpo had
died of small-pox. He was one of the most distinguished
scholars of Tibet, and held the highest position in the
Court of Potala. The day on which the ceremony was
performed was the twenty-seventh day of this chief
L&#257;ma&rsquo;s <i>Bardo</i> (<a href="#Page_371">p. 371</a>); that is, of the interval of forty-nine
days between his death and his translation to
another world. (According to J&auml;schke the interval of
the intermediate state only lasts for forty days.)</p>
<p>The Dalai L&#257;ma, seated on his throne, chanted a
hymn in a low indistinct voice. Afterwards the assembled
monks in grave tones repeated what the Grand
L&#257;ma had uttered. Then a venerable personage rose
from the middle of the first row of seats, and addressing
the Grand L&#257;ma as the incarnate Lord Chenressig
(Avalokite&#7777;vara), recited all the many acts of mercy
performed by him, as the patron-saint of Tibet, for the
benefit of its people. Next, he made offerings of certain
precious things (including an imaginary presentation of
the seven mythical treasures<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a>) for the benefit of the
soul of the late Khanpo, saying:&mdash;&lsquo;I pray that you
may graciously accept these presents for the good of
all living beings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Finally, he prostrated himself three times before the
Grand L&#257;ma&rsquo;s throne. A solemn pause followed; after
which the audience rose, and the Grand L&#257;ma retired.
Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s goes on to relate that at the end
of the ceremony one of the assistant L&#257;mas gave him
two packets of pills, and another tied a scrap of red
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
silk round his neck. The pills, he was told, were
chinlab or blessings, consecrated by the Buddha and
other saints; and the consecrated scrap of silk, called
sungd&#363;, &lsquo;knot of blessing,&rsquo; was the Grand L&#257;ma&rsquo;s usual
return for presents made to him by pilgrims and devotees.</p>
<p>We may note here that in 1866 the Indian explorer
Nain Singh saw the then Dalai L&#257;ma. He was a
handsome boy about thirteen years old, and was seated
on a throne six feet high. He had the Regent on his
right hand. He was said to be in his thirteenth transmigration<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Schlagintweit (p. 239) describes a ceremony in
which consecrated water (thui) is poured from a teapot-like
vessel over a metallic mirror (pp. <a href="#Page_458">458</a>, <a href="#Page_463">463</a> of these
Lectures), which is held so as to reflect the image of
Gautama Buddha seated on the altar. This water falls
down into a flat vessel containing a bag filled with
rice, and is then suitable for ceremonial ablutions.</p>
<p>Another ceremony (called Nyungne? by Schlagintweit),
involving long abstinence, lasts for four days.</p>
<p>The first and second days are passed in preparations.
Those who are to take part in the ceremony rise at
sunrise, bathe and prostrate themselves several times
before the image of Avalokite&#7777;vara. The head L&#257;ma
then bids them confess their faults, and meditate
on the evils resulting from demerit. He next, with his
attendants, recites extracts from certain books of confession.
This goes on till ten o&rsquo;clock, when tea is
taken. After this the recitations and prayer-recitals
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
continue till two o&rsquo;clock, when a meal of vegetables is
eaten. Then comes a pause, but the prayers and
readings are afterwards carried on till late at night, tea
being handed round at intervals. Before retiring to
rest, the head L&#257;ma specifies the various duties to be
performed by the devotees on the following day, and
orders them, as a penance, to sleep in &lsquo;the lion-posture,&rsquo;
viz. to lie on the right side, to stretch out the feet and
to support the head with the right hand<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a>.</p>
<p>The third day is the most important, and is passed
in rigorous abstinence from all food. No one is even
allowed to swallow his saliva, which must be ejected
into a vessel placed before him. Not a word must be
spoken. Each man prays and confesses his sins, but
does so in absolute silence. This continues till sunrise
on the fourth day.</p>
<p>It was at first the rule that repetitions of the Law,
confessions of sin (especially the P&#257;timokkha), and some
of the chief religious ceremonies (including fasting)
should take place, more particularly on the days of new
and full moon (called Uposatha, <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>).</p>
<p>Thus we read that &lsquo;on the day of full moon &#256;nanda
purified himself, and went up to the upper story of his
house to keep the sacred day&rsquo; (Mah&#257;sudassana-sutra,
1-10). This was in conformity with the ancient
Br&#257;hmanical rule that every new-moon day (Dar&#7777;a)
and every full-moon day (Paur&#7751;am&#257;sa) should be set
apart for special religious observances<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">337</div>
<p>In later times the intermediate quarter-moon days
were also held sacred, and so the number of Uposatha
days (see <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>) was increased to four in every month,
or once a week. Very strict Buddhists in Tibet eat
nothing on these days between sunrise and sunset
except farinaceous food with tea (<a href="#Page_346">p. 346</a>).</p>
<p>The laity are invited to join in keeping the Uposatha
days, but take no real part in the detail of the services.
The same rule applies to all religious ceremonies. Laymen
may be present at any rite, but without co-operating
in carrying out the ritual. Still, laymen have their
own part to perform. They look on&mdash;listen, tell their
rosaries, and repeat short prayers&mdash;such as the &lsquo;three-refuge&rsquo;
and &lsquo;jewel-lotus&rsquo; formula (pp. <a href="#Page_78">78</a>, <a href="#Page_370">370</a>)&mdash;and
make declarations to avoid the five great sins (<a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>).
Or they walk up to the image-altar and place offerings
on it, or bow before it and receive the L&#257;ma&rsquo;s benediction.
Theoretically, the laity only exist to honour and support
the monkhood, and to be blessed by them in return.
At all events a layman&rsquo;s religion is usually restricted
to a very limited range of duty.</p>
<p>One common way of showing piety is by walking
round temples, monasteries, St&#363;pas, and sacred walls
(see pp. <a href="#Page_380">380</a>, <a href="#Page_505">505</a>), from east to west, keeping the right
shoulder towards them, and even occasionally measuring
the ground with the extended body.</p>
<p>This last task is by no means a light or easy one.
According to M. Huc (i. 202), a whole day scarcely
suffices to perform the circumambulation when the
monastic buildings and temples occupy an extensive
area. People begin at daybreak, and the feat must
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">338</span>
be accomplished all at one time, without any break,
or even a few moments&rsquo; pause for taking nourishment.
Moreover, the measuring-process must be perfect;
&lsquo;the body must be extended to its whole length, and
the forehead must touch the earth while the arms are
stretched out in front and the hands joined.&rsquo; At each
prostration a circle must be drawn on the ground with
two rams&rsquo; horns held in the hands. &lsquo;It is a sorrowful
spectacle, and the unfortunate people often have their
faces and clothes covered with dust and mud. The
utmost severity of the weather does not present any
obstacle to their courageous devotion. They continue
their prostrations through rain, snow, and cold. Sometimes
they go through the additional penance of carrying
an enormous weight of books on their backs. You
meet with men, women, and even children sinking
under these excessive burdens. When they have
finished their circumambulation, they are considered to
have acquired the same merit as if they had recited all
the prayers contained in the books they have carried.&rsquo;
In point of fact they are generally far too ignorant to
be able to read the books, and the carrying of them on
their backs is taken as an adequate equivalent.</p>
<p>The acquisition of merit by circumambulation is not
an exclusively Hind&#363; or Buddhist idea. The Holy
House at Loretto near Ancona&mdash;believed to have been
transported there from Bethlehem by angels&mdash;is circumambulated
by pilgrims on their knees, but keeping the
sacred object to the left. Indeed, we may fitly conclude
the present Lecture by a comparison between the ritual
of Tibetan Buddhism and that of Roman Catholicism&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_339">339</span>
comparison, too, drawn by the Roman Catholic Missionaries
themselves:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The cross, the mitre, the dalmatica, the cope, which
Grand L&#257;mas wear on their journeys, or when they are
performing some ceremony out of the temple; the
service with double choirs, the psalmody, the exorcisms,
the censer for incense, suspended from five chains, and
opened or closed at pleasure; the benedictions pronounced
by the L&#257;mas by extending the right hand
over the heads of the faithful; the chaplet, ecclesiastical
celibacy, spiritual retirement, the worship of
the saints, the fasts, the processions, the litanies, the
holy water, all these are analogies between the Buddhists
and ourselves&rsquo; (Huc, ii. 50). To these may be
added sacred images, sacred pictures, sacred symbols,
relics, lamps, and illuminations<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a>.</p>
<p>This is doubtless a true comparison. But it does not
follow that the opinion which the missionaries express&mdash;&lsquo;that
these analogies are of Christian origin&rsquo;&mdash;is equally
deserving of our assent. No doubt one chief feature of
Buddhism, as of Hind&#363;ism<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a>, is its receptivity, but may
it not be the case that human nature and human tendencies
will be found to assert themselves independently
in every part of the world, wherever surrounding circumstances
are favourable to their development?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_340">340</div>
<h2 id="c18">LECTURE XIII.
<br /><i>Festivals, Domestic Rites, and Formularies of Prayer.</i></h2>
<p>We must now turn to the consideration of some of the
chief festivals, domestic rites, and prayer-formularies of
Buddhism&mdash;a subject which follows as a natural sequel
to the last Lecture.</p>
<p>It is well known that the Hind&#363;s have certain festivals
and holy days, celebrated at the junction of the
seasons which in India are properly six in number&mdash;namely,
spring, summer, the rains (Varsha), autumn,
winter, and the season of dew and mist (see &lsquo;Indian
Wisdom,&rsquo; p. 450; &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 428).</p>
<p>Buddhism has adopted the old Hind&#363; ideas on this
subject, and has added others of its own, but generally
only reckons three seasons&mdash;summer, the rains (Vassa
= Varsha) and winter.</p>
<p>The festival of the New Year is, of course, universal.
It is supposed to celebrate the victory of light over
darkness, and, in Buddhist countries, of Buddhism over
ignorance. The corresponding Hind&#363; festival is called
Makara-sa&#7749;kr&#257;nti. In India this marks the termination
of the inauspicious month Pausha and the beginning of
the sun&rsquo;s northern course (uttar&#257;ya&#7751;a) in the heavens.
It is a season of general rejoicing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
<p>In Burma, where a good type of Southern Buddhism
is still to be found, the New Year&rsquo;s festival might
suitably be called a &lsquo;water-festival.&rsquo; It has there so
little connexion with the increase of the New Year&rsquo;s
light, that it often takes place as late as the early half
of April (see Mr. Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Burman,&rsquo; ii. 48). It is, however,
a movable feast, the date of which is regularly
fixed by the astrologers of Mandalay, &lsquo;who make intricate
calculations based on the position of various
constellations.&rsquo; The object is to determine on what
precise day the king of the Naths (see <a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a> of this
volume) will descend upon the earth and inaugurate
the new year. When the day arrives all are on the
watch, and just at the right moment&mdash;which invariably
occurs at midnight&mdash;a cannon is fired off, announcing
the descent of the Nath-king upon earth. Forthwith
(according to Mr. Scott) men and women sally out of
their houses, carrying pots full of water consecrated by
fresh leaves and twigs of a sacred tree (<a href="#Page_514">p. 514</a> of this
volume), repeat a formal prayer, and pour out the water
on the ground. At the same time all who have guns
of any kind discharge them, so as to greet the new year
with as much noise as possible.</p>
<p>Then, &lsquo;with the first glimmer of light,&rsquo; all take jars
full of fresh water and carry them off to the nearest
monastery. First they present them to the monks,
and then proceed to bathe the images. This work is
usually done by the women of the party, &lsquo;who reverently
clamber up&rsquo; and empty their goblets of water
over the placid features of the Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas.
Then begin the Saturnalia. All along the
<span class="pb" id="Page_342">342</span>
road are urchins with squirts and syringes, with which
they have been furtively practising for the last few
days. The skill thus acquired is exhibited by the
accuracy of their aim. Cold streams of water catch the
ears of the passers by. Young men and girls salute
one another with the contents of jars and goblets.
Shouts of merriment are heard in every quarter. Before
breakfast every one is soaked, but no one thinks
of changing his garments, for the weather is warm, and
&lsquo;water is everywhere.&rsquo; The girls are the most enthusiastic,
and as they generally go in bands and carry
copious reservoirs along with them, &lsquo;unprotected males&rsquo;
are soon routed. Then a number of &lsquo;zealous people&rsquo;
go down to the river, wade into the water knee-deep,
splash about and drench one another till they are tired.
No one escapes. For three days no one likes to be
seen with dry clothes. The wetting is a compliment.
A clerk comes up to his master, bows, and &lsquo;gravely
pours the contents of a silver cup down the back
of his neck,&rsquo; saying, &lsquo;let me do homage to you with
water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It appears from Mr. Scott&rsquo;s amusing narrative that,
when there was a king in Burma, an important feature
of the festival was the formal washing of his Majesty&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>The New Year&rsquo;s rejoicings in Ceylon require no
special notice.</p>
<p>In Tibet the New Year&rsquo;s festival properly begins at
new moon, and may be delayed till some time in
February. The festival lasts fifteen days, and, as usual,
is a season of general festivity, gifts, congratulations,
<span class="pb" id="Page_343">343</span>
mummery, dancing, and acting. It is the L&#257;mistic
carnival.</p>
<p>According to M. Huc (ii. 216) the rejoicings commence
(as in Burma) at midnight. At Lh&#257;ssa all the
inhabitants sit up, awaiting the solemn moment which
is to close the old year and open the new. The usages
differ so curiously from those customary in Southern
Buddhist countries, that I here give an abbreviated
version of the two French travellers&rsquo; experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not being at all eager to watch for the moment of separation
between the two Tibetan years, we went to bed at our usual hour,
and were wrapped in profound slumber, when we were suddenly
awakened by cries of joy issuing from all quarters of the town. Bells,
cymbals, conchs, tambourines, and all the instruments of Tibetan
music, were set to work together and produced the most frightful
uproar imaginable. We had a good mind to get up to witness the
happiness of the inhabitants of Lh&#257;ssa, but the cold was so cutting
that, after reflection, we decided to remain under our woollen coverlets,
and to unite ourselves in heart only with the public felicity.
Unhappily for our comfort, violent knocks on our door, threatening
to smash it into splinters, warned us that we must renounce our
project. We therefore donned our clothes, and the door being opened,
some friendly Tibetans rushed into our room, inviting us to the New
Year&rsquo;s banquet. They all bore in their hands a small vessel made of
baked earth, in which balls of honey and flour floated on boiling
water. One visitor offered us a long silver needle, terminating in a
hook, and invited us to fish in his basin. At first we sought to
excuse ourselves, objecting that we were not in the habit of taking
food during the night, but they entreated us so warmly, and put out
their tongues at us with so friendly a grace, that we were obliged to
comply, and resign ourselves to a participation in the New Year&rsquo;s
festivities. Each of us, therefore, hooked a ball, which we then
crushed between our teeth to ascertain its flavour. For politeness
sake we had to swallow the dose, but not without making some
grimaces. Nor could we get off with this first act of devotion. The
New Year was inexorable. Our numerous friends at Lh&#257;ssa succeeded
<span class="pb" id="Page_344">344</span>
each other almost without interruption, and we had perforce to munch
Tibetan sweetmeats till daybreak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is said that other peculiar customs follow, one of
which the Tibetans call the Lh&#257;ssa-Moru. This takes
place on the third day, and leads to the invasion of
the town and its environs by innumerable bands of
L&#257;mas. Immense numbers of L&#257;mas, some on foot,
some on horseback, some on asses or oxen, and all
carrying cooking-utensils and prayer-books, crowd into
Lh&#257;ssa from all points. The town is completely over-run.
Those who cannot get lodgings encamp in the
streets and squares, or pitch their tents in the suburbs.
The tribunals are closed, and the course of justice is
suspended. The L&#257;mas parade the streets in disorderly
bands, uttering discordant cries, pushing one another
about, quarrelling, fighting, and yet, in the midst of all,
chanting their prayers (Huc, ii. 218).</p>
<p>In Tibet there is a &lsquo;water-festival&rsquo; in the seventh
or eighth month (about our August and September).
At this festival the L&#257;mas go in procession to rivers
and lakes, and consecrate the waters by benediction
or by throwing in offerings. Huts and tents are erected
on the banks, and people bathe and drink to wash away
their sins. It concludes with dancing, buffoonery, and
masquerading.</p>
<p>The festival of Gautama Buddha&rsquo;s conception, or of
the Buddha&rsquo;s <i>last</i> birth&mdash;for it must be borne in mind
that, before Buddhahood, he went through innumerable
previous births&mdash;is a most important anniversary in
all Buddhist countries, but the right date has been the
occasion of much controversy. The event is generally
<span class="pb" id="Page_345">345</span>
celebrated at the end of April, or beginning of May,
or on a day corresponding to the 15th day of the
Hind&#363; month Vai&#7777;&#257;kha, which is also sometimes given
as the date of the Buddha&rsquo;s attainment of Buddhahood,
and of his death. Everywhere throughout the modern
Buddhist world the Buddha&rsquo;s birthday is kept by the
worship of his images, followed by processions.</p>
<p>As to the day of his death, Sarat Chandra D&#257;s was
at Lh&#257;ssa on June 1, 1882, and wrote thus:&mdash;&lsquo;To-day
being the holiest day of the year&mdash;the anniversary of
Buddha&rsquo;s Nirv&#257;&#7751;a&mdash;the burning of incense in every
shrine, chapel, monastery, and house, darkened the
atmosphere with smoke. Men hastened to the great
temple to do homage to the Buddha and to obtain his
blessing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;festival of lamps&rsquo; is an important anniversary
with all Buddhists. The Hind&#363;s have their D&#299;v&#257;l&#299; or
feast of illuminations (see &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo;
p. 432) when the cold season begins. The early Buddhists
marked the end of the rainy season (Vassa =
Varsha), which terminated their period of retirement, by
a day of rejoicing (see <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>). In process of time they
connected the celebration of Gautama&rsquo;s descent from
heaven (<a href="#Page_417">p. 417</a>) with the termination of Vassa.</p>
<p>In Tibet the orthodox followers of the Dalai L&#257;ma
have a festival of their own, with illuminations, on the
25th day of the 10th month (Nov.&mdash;Dec.), to celebrate
the ascension of Tsong Khapa to heaven (<a href="#Page_280">p. 280</a>). Sarat
Chandra D&#257;s was at Tashi Lunpo on this day in 1881,
when &lsquo;hundreds of lamp-burners were tastefully placed
in rows on the roof of every building.&rsquo; The illuminations
<span class="pb" id="Page_346">346</span>
of the temples, tombs, and grand monastery &lsquo;presented
a magnificent appearance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the season called Vassa, it should be
noted here that since there is no rainy period of the
year in Tibet which corresponds to the Indian &lsquo;Rains,&rsquo;
certain seasons of abstinence from food are observed
either before, or at the same time with the great Festivals.
These periods of fasting are distributed equally throughout
the year&mdash;one in February, one in May, one in July,
one in November or December.</p>
<p>The festivals and holy days thus briefly described,
are by no means the only festivals of Buddhism. There
are numerous other special and local ones. For example,
in Ceylon, the Sinhalese celebrate the coming of the
Buddha to their island and his victory over the R&#257;kshasas
and evil demons by a festival in March or April,
when the greater number of pilgrims flock to his supposed
foot-print on Adam&rsquo;s Peak, or to the sacred
Bodhi-tree at Anur&#257;dha-pura (see <a href="#Page_519">p. 519</a>). Other Southern
countries have festivals connected with the worship of
special foot-prints and relics of their own.</p>
<p>Then the L&#257;mas in Lh&#257;ssa keep the day of the worship
of the Dorje (see <a href="#Page_322">p. 322</a>) on the 27th day of the
first month, while those in Sikkim celebrate as a festival
the day on which the Lepchas make offerings to the
spirit of the mountain Kinchinjunga.</p>
<p>Then, again, at the beginning of the third month an
exhibition of sacred vessels and pictures takes place at
Lh&#257;ssa, accompanied by processions in masks, the L&#257;mas
appearing as good genii, and the laity as tigers, leopards,
elephants, &amp;c.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_347">347</div>
<p>In other places, too, there are special festivals. For
example, a singular festival, called &lsquo;Chase of the spirit-kings,&rsquo;
is kept by Northern Buddhists on the 30th of the
second month, when there is a vast amount of religious
dancing (with tediously slow movements), masquerading,
mummery, and buffoonery, not unlike the devil-dancing
which goes on in Ceylon, and closely connected with
the universal belief in demons and evil spirits.</p>
<p>The most hideous masks are used on these occasions.
In 1884 I had an opportunity of inspecting in a Buddhist
monastery near D&#257;rj&#299;ling a most singular assortment
of religious masks, which for distortion of feature
and horrible unsightliness, could scarcely be matched
anywhere; for indeed mask-making is an art which
Buddhism has brought to the greatest perfection. I also
witnessed a religious dance performed by a party of
masqueraders which struck me as a remarkable example
of the utter debasement of Buddhism in Northern
countries.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bridges describes a similar religious dance in
Lad&#257;k thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;A group of grinning masks&mdash;lions&rsquo; heads and harlequins&rsquo; bodies&mdash;came
down the steps, and whirling slowly round, retreated again into
the gloom and came out dragon-headed. Then a band of skeletons,
the skulls (masks) admirably painted, gnashing their hideous jaws
and shaking their lanky limbs, rushed out into the sunshine and
executed a real &ldquo;Dance of Death&rdquo; before us.&rsquo; (&lsquo;Travels,&rsquo; p. 101.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet all true Buddhists are prohibited from dancing
and masquerading (<a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a> of this volume); just as
Manu (II. 178, IV. 15, 212) prohibited Br&#257;hmans from
engaging in similar frivolities.</p>
<p>Then the religious dramas performed on some of
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
the Buddhist festive days are not the least interesting
examples of the present prevalent superstitions.</p>
<p>I witnessed part of a dramatic performance at a Burmese
Theatre in Calcutta (during the Exhibition year),
when the story of the Hind&#363; Epic, called R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a,
and especially that portion of it which relates to the
carrying off of S&#299;t&#257; by demons (see &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and
Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 42, and &lsquo;Indian Wisdom,&rsquo; p. 337), was dramatically
represented. The theatre was a rude wooden
enclosure open to the sky, with the exception of a portion
roofed over for a band of musicians, whose noisy
performances appeared to constitute an important
element in the proceedings. The chief musician sat
on the ground in the middle of a circular frame-work&mdash;about
two or three feet high&mdash;hung round with drums
of different sizes, which he struck with his hands, and
occasionally tuned by the application of moist clay in
larger or smaller lumps. In the centre of the open
area of flat dusty soil which served for the stage, a big
branch of a tree was stuck upright, possibly to represent
the forest in which R&#257;ma lived with his wife.
Then the hero and heroine of the drama&mdash;R&#257;ma and
S&#299;t&#257;&mdash;kept up a tedious colloquy, interspersed with
jokes, for hours. The former&mdash;who, be it remembered,
was supposed to be a god&mdash;smoked a cigar all the while,
and occasionally ejected saliva with perfect indifference
to all appearances and to all laws of congruity, while
every now and again S&#299;t&#257;, in spite of a tight dress,
varied the monotony of the dialogue by executing
a slow dance, characterized by strange contortions,
twistings, and wrigglings of the limbs. Hideous masks
<span class="pb" id="Page_349">349</span>
were at intervals assumed by the actors, and, of course,
by the demons who intervened at odd moments with
much ludicrous gesticulation. The action of the play
went on continuously for about ten days, during which
period people came and went as they liked, and the
last comers entered into the progress of the plot with
as much interest as if they had witnessed the whole.
There is never much originality of invention in these
religious plays. The Indian heroic poems and the five
hundred and fifty birth-stories (see <a href="#Page_63">p. 63</a>) of the Buddha
furnish the basis of all.</p>
<p>The religious dramas of Tibet are of a somewhat
different character. The following description is founded
on Dr. Schlagintweit&rsquo;s account (<a href="#Page_233">p. 233</a>), and on that
of Mrs. Bridges in her interesting &lsquo;Travels&rsquo; (John
Murray, 1883, p. 130).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dramatis person&aelig; consist of three classes.&mdash;1. Tutelary deities
or good genii, called Dragshed (Drag&#7777;ed), who ward off the assaults of
evil demons; 2. Evil demons; 3. Men. The actors of each class are
distinguished by their masks. The first class&mdash;that is the Dragsheds
or good genii&mdash;wear masks of enormous size and terrific aspect<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a>. The
second class&mdash;that is the Evil demons&mdash;wear larger masks of a dark
colour, and their garments are well padded to deaden the force of the
blows showered upon them. The third class&mdash;that is the Men&mdash;wear
the usual dress of human beings, and masks of a natural size and
colour, while under their clothes they carry heavy wooden sticks, with
which at times, during the progress of the drama, they belabour the
demons. The gods also get well knocked about by the demons, much
to the amusement of the spectators.</p>
<p>The drama is preceded by the recital of hymns and prayers and by
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
noisy music. The Dragsheds occupy the centre, the men are on their
right and the demons on their left. At short intervals the men and
the demons execute slow dances, each group by itself. At last, an
evil spirit and a man step forth. The evil spirit then tries, in a
plausible speech, to tempt the man to violate some precept of morality,
while other evil spirits approach and chime in. The man at first
stands firm, but gradually gives way and is about to yield, when other
men come forward and entreat him not to be seduced by the artful
suggestions of the demons. He is then closely pressed by the two
opposite parties, but in the end takes the advice of his human
counsellors. Upon this all the men break out into praise of the Dragsheds,
to whose presence and assistance they ascribe the victory. The
Dragsheds now proceed to punish the evil demons. The leading
Dragshed, who is distinguished by an unusually large yellow mask,
advances against them surrounded by about a dozen followers. Other
Dragsheds next rush out from the back-ground, shoot arrows, throw
stones, and even fire with muskets upon the demons, while the men
belabour them with their sticks, hitherto concealed under their
clothes. The demons are routed, and run in every direction pursued
by the good genii. The drama concludes by all the actors (men and
demons included) singing hymns in honour of the victorious tutelary
genii.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the spectators (at the performance witnessed
by Mrs. Bridges at Leh) were six deities, represented
by six L&#257;mas seated on a bench with umbrellas over
their heads. They had incense swung before them by
attendant priests.</p>
<p>This curious dramatic performance is paralleled in
India by the Hind&#363; drama called Prabodha-&#263;androdaya,
&lsquo;Rise of the moon of true knowledge,&rsquo; in which we
have Faith, Volition, Opinion, Imagination, Contemplation,
Devotion, Quietude, Friendship, &amp;c., on one
side; Error, Self-conceit, Hypocrisy, Love, Passion,
Anger, Avarice, on the other. The two sets of characters
are, of course, opposed to each other, the object
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
of the play being to show how the orthodox faith of the
Hind&#363;s became victorious over the erroneous doctrine
of the Buddha&mdash;the Buddhists and other heretical sects
being represented as adherents of the losing side.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;to take a parallel nearer home&mdash;we find similar
religious dramas acted in England not so very long ago
(about the time of Henry VIII). For example, in the
old English morality play, called &lsquo;Every-man,&rsquo; some of
the dramatis person&aelig; on the one side are&mdash;God, Death,
Every-man, Fellowship, Kindred, Good-deeds, Knowledge,
Confession, Beauty, Strength, Discretion; while on
the other are personifications of the opposite qualities.
Then, again, in &lsquo;Lusty Juventus,&rsquo; we have a medley of
Good Counsel, Knowledge, Satan, Hypocrisy, Fellowship,
Abominable Living, God&rsquo;s Merciful Promises.</p>
<p>And here with reference to the supposed contest continually
going on between good and evil, and the participation
of human beings in this terrible struggle, we
may note that the mystical thunderbolt called Dorje
(<a href="#Page_322">p. 322</a>) is not the only implement of spiritual warfare
employed by the L&#257;mas against the demons<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a>. Another
important weapon is the Phurbu or &lsquo;nail,&rsquo; described as
triangular and wedge-shaped, with the thin end very
sharp-pointed, and with the head of Tamdin (a particular
Dragshed = Haya-gr&#299;va, noted for his power)
emerging from the broad end and surmounted by a
half-thunderbolt for a handle.</p>
<p>According to Schlagintweit, this weapon is often made
of cardboard, on which mystical sentences (Dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#299;s) in
<span class="pb" id="Page_352">352</span>
Sansk&#7771;it are inscribed, some against the demons of the
South, some against those of the East, and some against
those of the South-east. In case of illness a L&#257;ma goes
round the house turning the point of the Phurbu in all
directions and uttering magical spells.</p>
<p>Most of the Dh&#257;ara&#7751;&#299;s end with the syllables H&#363;m
phat&#7789;, the potency of which in scaring evil demons is
irresistible. Many charms begin with Ah Tamdin.</p>
<p>Those Phurbus are considered most efficacious which
are inscribed with mystical syllables and words composed
by either the Dalai L&#257;ma or Panchen L&#257;ma.
These are sold for large sums. It is said (Schlagintweit,
260) that such Phurbus form an important article
of trade for the Mongolian pilgrims returning from Tibet.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to meet with a remarkable
specimen of a magical weapon of this kind (called
Phur-pa by J&auml;schke) made of metal, and shaped like a
dagger with three edges, one for each of the three
classes of demons inhabiting the three quarters. The
handle is composed of a Dorje (<a href="#Page_322">p. 322</a>), and is surmounted
by carvings of the heads of the three most
powerful Dragsheds. I here give a representation
of it<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/i352.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="68" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_353">353</div>
<p>It may be easily understood that among a people,
steeped in superstition, a man armed with such a
weapon as this&mdash;composed of the heads of three potent
genii, a divine thunderbolt and a triple-edged dagger&mdash;would
be regarded as a match for the whole demon-host.</p>
<p>In Burma the tattooing of mystical squares, triangles
and cabalistic diagrams and figures on various parts of
the body, seems to be regarded as a sufficient substitute
for the use of magical weapons, and is held to be highly
efficacious.</p>
<p>Obviously we may contrast the Christian armoury
described by S. Paul (Ephes. vi. 11), &lsquo;the shield of faith
and the sword of the Spirit.&rsquo; We might also contrast
the words of Christ, &lsquo;Rejoice not, that the spirits are
subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names
are written in heaven&rsquo; (S. Luke x. 20).</p>
<h3><i>Domestic Rites and Usages.</i></h3>
<p>I now pass on to domestic rites and usages, which are
as numerous and important in Buddhist countries as in
India. It is said, indeed, that in Tibet and Mongolia no
one is so poor as not to possess an altar in his dwelling
on which he daily lays his offerings, and before which
he performs devotions.</p>
<p>In Ceylon and Burma certain ceremonies take place
soon after the birth of a child. Mr. Scott, describing
those in Burma, says that a fortnight after birth a fortunate
day and hour is fixed by an astrologer for the
naming of the infant. A feast is prepared, and all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_354">354</span>
friends and relations of the family are invited. &lsquo;The
child&rsquo;s head is usually washed for the first time on this
day,&rsquo; and some one suggests a name.</p>
<p>The name actually given appears to be a matter of
choice, but this is not so. The consonants of the language
are divided into groups, which are assigned to the
days of the week, Sunday having all the vowels to itself.
&lsquo;It is an invariable rule in all respectable families that
the child&rsquo;s name must begin with one of the letters
belonging to the day on which it was born, but within
these limits any name may be chosen.&rsquo; A common
belief is that, according to the day of the week (or
rather the constellation representing that day) on which
a child is born, so will its character be.</p>
<p>In this way every person&rsquo;s probable characteristics
may be inferred. For example, a man born on a Monday
is likely to be jealous; on Tuesday, honest; on
Wednesday, hot-tempered&mdash;but soon appeased&mdash;this
characteristic being intensified under the influence of
R&#257;hu<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a>.</p>
<p>Then, again, if born on a Thursday, a man will probably
be mild; on Friday, talkative; on Saturday, ill-tempered
and quarrelsome; on Sunday, parsimonious.
Saturday is a bad day for everything. Not only has
every day its special character and its fixed letters, but
there is also (according to Mr. Scott) a particular animal
assigned to symbolize it&mdash;for example, a guinea-pig
stands for Friday; a dragon for Saturday; a tiger for
Monday&mdash;and red or yellow wax candles are made in
<span class="pb" id="Page_355">355</span>
the forms of these animals to be offered at the Pagoda
by the pious. Each worshipper offers the creature-candle
representing his birth-day.</p>
<p>Then a careful note is made of the exact hour of
birth, with the important object of drawing up the
child&rsquo;s horoscope. This may be delayed till the fifth
or sixth year, and a Br&#257;hman astrologer may be called
in for the purpose. He records the year, the month,
the day and hour at which the child was born; the
name given to it and the planet in the ascendant at
the moment. All this is scratched neatly on a palm-leaf
with a metal style. On the other side are a number
of cabalistic squares and numbers from which future
calculations may be made.</p>
<p>A person born on Monday remains under the influence
of the moon for fifteen years. Then he passes under
Mars for eight years. At the age of twenty-three
Mercury presides over him, and so on through all the
planets to the end of his life, which may be protracted
to 108 years.</p>
<p>R&#257;hu, and especially Saturn, have a particularly
sinister influence. A man does most of the stupid and
wicked things in his life while he is in Saturn&rsquo;s
house. Other details will be found in &lsquo;Shway Yoe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The horoscope is carefully kept by the parents until
the child is old enough to take care of it himself, and
thenceforward it is guarded as a valuable possession.</p>
<p>All these Buddhist customs have their counterpart in
the ceremonies of Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism.</p>
<p>For example, the Hind&#363;s have their birth-ceremonies
(J&#257;ta-karman), and their name-giving ceremony (N&#257;ma-kara&#7751;a<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a>),
and the latter is a solemn religious act fraught
<span class="pb" id="Page_356">356</span>
with momentous consequences in its bearing on a child&rsquo;s
future. Hence Hind&#363; boys are generally called after
some god, or the name indicates that the child is
the god&rsquo;s servant. Horoscopes, too, are as important
in India as in Buddhist countries<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a>.</p>
<p>In India, too, all Br&#257;hman boys go through the
ceremony of tonsure and cutting off the hair.</p>
<p>Among the Buddhists of Burma a boy is sent to the
monastery school at about the age of eight. Before
he can become a novice he has to undergo the hair-abscission
ceremony, followed by shaving every fort-night
(as before described). But those who afterwards
elect to lead a secular life wear long hair, to wash
which is regarded as a kind of religious ceremonial, and
only to be performed about once a month, partly, says
Mr. Scott, because the washing of a Burman&rsquo;s luxuriant
hair takes a long time, and partly because too frequent
ablutions &lsquo;would disturb and irritate the good genius
who dwells in the head and protects the man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is considered unlucky to wash the head on a
Monday, Friday, or Saturday; and &lsquo;parents sending
their boy to a monastery must remember not to cut
his hair off on a Monday, or on a Friday, or on his
birth-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is noticeable that a kind of baptism is practised
in Tibet and Mongolia. It is usual to sprinkle
<span class="pb" id="Page_357">357</span>
children with consecrated water, or even to immerse
them entirely on the third or tenth day after birth.
This is called Khrus-sol (according to J&auml;schke).</p>
<p>The priest consecrates the water by reciting some
formula, while candles and incense are burning. He
then dips the child three times, blesses it, and gives it
a name. After performing the ceremony, he draws up
the infant&rsquo;s horoscope.</p>
<p>Then, so soon as the child can walk and talk, a
second ceremony takes place, when prayers are said for
its happy life, and an amulet or little bag is hung
round its neck, filled with spells and charms against
evil spirits and diseases.</p>
<p>The use of <i>amulets</i> (Sansk&#7771;it kava&#263;a), charms and
spells in Northern Buddhist countries is universal.</p>
<p>At D&#257;rj&#299;ling I noticed that among the crowds of
persons who frequented the bazaar&mdash;many of whom
were travellers from Tibet, Nep&#257;l, Bhut&#257;n, and Sikkim&mdash;almost
every one wore an amulet, or a string of
amulets round the neck. Most of these amulets are
simply ornamental boxes or receptacles for supposed
relics of saints, or for little images, or pictures,
or for prayer-formularies, worn like breast-plates or
phylacteries. They are composed of wood, bone, and
not infrequently of beautifully-worked filigree silver,
embossed and ornamented with turquoise. The shape
is sometimes square, sometimes circular or curved, and
brought round to a point<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a>. I purchased several specimens,
but the vendor of any amulet in actual use invariably
<span class="pb" id="Page_358">358</span>
removed the contents before consenting to part
with it. Here is a specimen of one of exceptionally beautiful
design which was given to me by Mr. Sarat Chandra
D&#257;s. It was taken from the neck of a woman in the
bazaar, but not purchased without much difficulty.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>We pass on next to the Buddhist <i>marriage-ceremony</i>.
This in Ceylon, Burma, Tibet, Mongolia, and indeed in
all Buddhist countries, is properly a purely civil contract
witnessed only by parents and guardians. We
have already pointed out, that true Buddhism considers
<span class="pb" id="Page_359">359</span>
celibacy to be the only sure means of attaining real
sanctity of character. Consistently with this idea, it
has not prescribed any religious ceremony to be performed
by monks or priests, as a condition of the validity
of marriage<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a>.</p>
<p>Hence among Buddhists the ceremony of marriage is
very simple, and has no religious character, or at any
rate no complicated religious observances connected
with it, as among the Hind&#363;s<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a>. In fact the celibate
monks of true Buddhism would be much scandalized if
they were asked to take part in the celebration of a
wedding, or even to ratify it by their presence.</p>
<p>The principal ceremony consists in a feast given
by the bridegroom or his parents, to which all the
relations, friends, and neighbours are invited. Nevertheless,
in most Buddhist countries in the present day
the monks manage to have some remunerative work to
do in connexion with weddings; for their business is to
fix the most auspicious days for the performance of the
ceremony, in return for which they receive offerings of
various kinds. We know that in India astrology is a
chief factor in all marriage-arrangements. Similarly in
most Buddhist countries no wedding can take place till
the astrologer, who is usually a monk-priest, has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_360">360</span>
consulted as to lucky and unlucky combinations, and
the benign or baleful aspects of planets and stars.
For example, in Burma, Saturdays and Thursdays are
pronounced unlucky days, and it would be the height
of imprudence to marry in certain months of the year.
Then, again, a woman born on a Friday would be guilty
of utter folly if she married a man born on a Monday,
seeing that one or other would soon die<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a>; and so on
through a long list of auspicious and inauspicious
potentialities.</p>
<p>It should, however, be set down to the credit of
Buddhism that wives and daughters are not imprisoned
in Zan&#257;nas, as among Hind&#363;s and Muhammadans. I
was present at an evening-party given by a rich native
of Ceylon, when the ladies of the family were introduced
to the European guests, and conversed freely with the
rest of the company. Nor is the marriage of mere boys
and girls insisted on in Buddhist countries as in India.
The bridegroom is seldom of a less age than eighteen
or nineteen.</p>
<p>Then, again, not only births and marriages, but illnesses
and death are in the present day a source of
revenue to the Buddhist monkhood.</p>
<p>First, as to <i>sickness</i>.</p>
<p>In Ceylon, when any one is dangerously ill, the
monk-priest is summoned from the neighbouring Vih&#257;ra,
after first sending offerings of flowers, oil, and food.
Then a temporary preaching-place is erected near the
house, and all the relatives and friends, and if possible
<span class="pb" id="Page_361">361</span>
the sick man himself, listen to the reading of the Law
(Ba&#7751;a) for about six hours. The part especially read
and intoned is the Ratna-valiya section of the Pirit
(see <a href="#Page_317">p. 317</a>). After the Ba&#7751;a a number of offerings are
given to the reciting priest, including a piece of calico,
one end of which is held by the priest, and the other
by the sick man. Then the priest pronounces a benediction,
and says words to the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;By
reverence do the wise secure health, by almsgiving do
they lay up treasures for themselves<a class="fn" id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the sick man is likely to die the priest
repeats the Three-refuge formula (<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>), the five
commandments (<a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>), and the Sati-pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na Sutta
(<a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>).</p>
<p>In Burma, if an epidemic happens to break out in
any village, the people begin by painting the supposed
figure of an evil spirit on a common earthenware water-pot,
and then solemnly smashing it to pieces at sunset
with a heavy stick<a class="fn" id="fr_170" href="#fn_170">[170]</a>. Then as soon as it gets dark all
the villagers shout, yell, shriek, and make every kind
of deafening din, with the hope of frightening away
the evil spirit who has caused the disease. This process
is continued for three nights, and if no good result
follows the monk-priests are called in from the monastery.
They recite the ten precepts, chant the Law up
and down the road, and intone a particular sermon of
the Buddha, by the preaching of which he once drove
<span class="pb" id="Page_362">362</span>
away a pestilence. These means are, of course, not
effective unless abundant alms and gifts are bestowed
upon the monastery.</p>
<p>According to Koeppen and Huc the art of medicine
in Northern Buddhist countries is practised exclusively
by the L&#257;mas. The theory is that there are 140
different maladies, and that most of these are caused
by devils. The monk-priests are the sole doctors, and a
sick person can only be cured by them. One process is
simple. It begins by the L&#257;ma doctor writing the name
of a remedy upon a morsel of paper, moistening it
with saliva, and rolling it into a pill. The patient
takes the paper pellet with as much faith as if he were
swallowing the veritable drug. Many Mongols believe
that &lsquo;it is precisely the same, whether you swallow a
drug or its written appellation.&rsquo; Then, &lsquo;if the patient
be poor, the devil is a little one, and may be dislodged
by a few prayers; but, if he be rich, the case is different;
fine clothes, handsome boots, or even a good horse must
be presented, or he will not consent to turn out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A very effective medicine may be composed of the
bones of some pious L&#257;ma ground into a powder. This
may be given alone or in combination with other substances.</p>
<p>It appears to be essential that the prayers recited on
these occasions should be accompanied by terrific noises.
M. Huc relates a story of an old woman&mdash;the aunt of a
certain chief&mdash;who was one day attacked by intermittent
fever. The L&#257;ma, of course, announced that a devil
had possession of her body; and so in the evening he
and eight other L&#257;mas began operations for its expulsion.
<span class="pb" id="Page_363">363</span>
First they made a little figure or manikin of
dried herbs, which they called the devil of intermittent
fevers. This they stuck upright in the tent of the sick
woman. Then at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night the L&#257;mas
ranged themselves at the back of the tent, armed with
bells, tambourines, conch-shells, and other noisy instruments.
Nine members of the family closed the
circle in front, crouching on the ground, while the old
woman remained seated on her heels in front of the
manikin. Next, &lsquo;at a given signal, the orchestra performed
an overture capable of scaring away the most
imperturbable and obstinate devil, while all the secular
assistants beat time with their hands to the hubbub of
the instruments and the howling of the prayers. When
this demoniacal music was over, the chief L&#257;ma began
his exorcisms, scattering millet seeds around as he proceeded;
sometimes speaking low, sometimes in stentorian
tones. Then, appearing to throw himself into a
passion, he addressed animated appeals, with violent
gesticulation, to the manikin.&rsquo; Finally, after further
incantations, he gave a signal; the L&#257;mas thundered
out a noisy chorus, the instruments added to the din,
and the members of the family rushing out in file, made
the circuit of the tent, striking it frantically with
stakes, and uttering terrific cries. Finally, the chief
L&#257;ma and his assistants, after joining in the yells, set
fire to the manikin. This ended the ceremony; the
demon being compelled to beat a retreat.</p>
<p>Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s has given an account of a
somewhat similar ceremony in Tibet performed by some
L&#257;mas to cure him of a sickness. An image representing
<span class="pb" id="Page_364">364</span>
the patient, and supposed to resemble him, was
constructed, and a suit of his clothes placed in front
of it, together with portions of his usual food and drink.
Two L&#257;mas then muttered mystic sentences, ringing a
bell, waving a Dorje (see <a href="#Page_323">p. 323</a> of these Lectures), and
twisting their fingers and hands into the mysterious
shapes called Mudr&#257; (<a href="#Page_241">p. 241</a>). Next they broke out
into alternate exhortations and threats, and at the
conclusion of the ceremony the officiating priests
supplicated the lord of death (Yama) to accept the
image in place of the moribund man.</p>
<p>On another occasion, when Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s
was seriously ill in Tibet, an effective method of curing
his disease was proposed to him, and, with his consent,
actually carried out. This mainly consisted in the
ransoming of fish-life. A certain L&#257;ma started off for
a fisherman&rsquo;s village, and in a short time returned in a
high state of satisfaction. He had saved the lives of
five hundred fishes for the benefit of the sick man.
The merit of this deed was credited to the patient on
his repeating the following prayer:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By virtue of my having ransomed the lives of these
animals, let health, longevity, prosperity, and happiness
perpetually accrue to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the same way in Burma, in times of great heat and
drought, when the ponds and tanks appear to be on the
point of drying up, it is held to be a work of enormous
merit to rescue fish, put them in jars, and transport
them alive to the rivers. (See Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Burman,&rsquo; ii. 43.)</p>
<p>Similarly a bird-catcher will sell live birds to pious
persons, that they may gain merit by releasing them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_365">365</div>
<p>We pass on, in the next place, to the usages and
ceremonies common at death.</p>
<p>If a man&rsquo;s soul is to be separated from his body
properly and peacefully, so as not to hurt the survivors,
and in a manner likely to cause a happy re-birth for
himself, alms must be bestowed on the monk-priests,
and their presence must be invited for the repetition of
prayers. In Ceylon and Burma monks go to the houses
of mourners and repeat portions of the Pirit (see <a href="#Page_317">p. 317</a>).</p>
<p>In Tibet the priest not only recites prayers but compresses
the skull till it appears to crack, or else the hair
is torn off and a little incision is made, to enable the
dying man&rsquo;s soul to escape. The priest then settles
what method of burial is to be followed, and the place,
day and hour, all of which depend on astrological
combinations, known only to him.</p>
<p>The method of disposing of a dead body differs in all
Buddhist countries according to station, condition, rank,
and wealth.</p>
<p>In Ceylon the bodies of monks are all burnt, and the
cremation ceremonies are carried out under decorated
arches or canopies, which are never removed, but left to
crumble away.</p>
<p>In Burma the cremation of a monk distinguished for
sanctity is an affair of great state and ceremonial. The
body (see Mr. Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Burman,&rsquo; ii. 331) is first embalmed,
and next tightly wrapped in white cloth, which
is varnished and afterwards covered with gold-leaf.
The corpse thus gilded is placed in an unclosed inner
coffin, and left exposed to view for a considerable time.
When fastened down, the inner coffin is covered with
<span class="pb" id="Page_366">366</span>
gold-leaf, like the body. An outer sarcophagus is then
prepared, and painted to represent scenes from the
lives of the Buddha. This is placed in a building
erected for the purpose, and there the body lies in state
for several months, while a constant line of pilgrim-worshippers
pass in and out. In process of time, when
enough money for the expenses has been collected, a
grand cremation takes place under a lofty canopy, which
on special occasions may be fifty or sixty feet high.
The calcined bones are then reverentially collected, and
either buried near the temple or pounded and made up
into a paste, with which an image of the Buddha is
constructed for worship in the monastery.</p>
<p>In Tibet the bodies of the Grand L&#257;mas are generally
embalmed and preserved in monuments or St&#363;pas. Other
L&#257;mas and monks distinguished for sanctity are burnt,
and their ashes are either distributed as relics, or preserved
in idols or in small D&#257;gabas. Kings, princes,
and great men are also burnt, and of course with much
ceremony and repetition of prayers. Then for a long time
afterwards prayers continue to be recited by the priests,
the object being to propitiate Yama, god of Death, and
to deliver the deceased from the possible purgatorial
torments of one of the hells. It is said that this repetition
of prayers is prolonged, in the case of the rich, for
seven weeks, and in the case of princes, for a whole year.</p>
<p>Mr. J. Ware Edgar, C.S.I., in his interesting Report
of his visit to Sikkim in 1873, gives a description
of the remarkable funeral ceremonies performed on
the occasion of the death of the R&#257;j&#257; of Sikkim&rsquo;s
sister (see <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>), which I here abbreviate:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_367">367</div>
<p>The R&#257;j&#257;&rsquo;s sister had died a few days after his return to Choombi.
The body had been buried at Choombi, but her clothes had been sent
to Toomlong, and her soul was supposed to accompany them. There
a lay-figure meant to represent her, dressed in her costume as a nun,
and wearing a gilt mitre and a long white veil, was placed on a kind
of throne to the right of the great altar in the principal chapel.
Before the figure was a table, on which were different kinds of food.
On another table were various things which had belonged to her,
while on a third, 108 little brass lamps were arranged in rows. Some
days afterwards the lay-figure of the nun was taken to Pemyangchi.
There, for three days the figure was seated before the altar, and the
monks chanted the litanies for her soul, which had accompanied her
clothes from Choombi. On the third day towards evening the tea-cup
of the nun was freshly filled with tea, and all the monks solemnly
drank tea with her. The monks chanted the litanies, and the Head
L&#257;ma went through some elaborate ceremonies. At about nine
o&rsquo;clock the chanting ceased, and the L&#257;ma made a long speech to
the soul of the nun, in which he told her that all that could be done
to make her journey to another world easy, had been done, and that
now she would have to go alone and unassisted to appear before the
King and Judge of the dead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will have to leave your robes, your mitre, and your veil,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;and clad in the black garment of your sins, or in the shining
garment of your good deeds, you will be shown the mirror of the just
King. Your gold and silver, your rank, your good name will not
help you, when your good deeds are weighed against your evil deeds,
in the scales of the King. If you have done ill, you will be punished;
but if your sins are found to be lighter than your good works, your
reward will be great indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the L&#257;ma had finished his address, some of the monks took
down the lay-figure and undressed it, while others formed a procession
and conducted the soul of the nun into the darkness outside
the monastery, with a discordant noise of conch-shells, thigh-bone
trumpets, Tibetan flutes, gongs, cymbals, tambourines, and drums.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Japan small portions of the calcined remains
(often not larger than peas) are preserved in globular
glass shrines, and then duly honoured and worshipped.</p>
<p>The method of disposing of the dead bodies of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_368">368</span>
laity and of the common people is generally much more
simple. In most Buddhist countries laymen are buried,
and the priests lead the processions to the grave. In
Ceylon, the laity are certainly, as a rule, buried and not
burnt.</p>
<p>In Burma rich laymen are also generally buried,
and, according to Mr. Scott, the funeral is a grand
affair.</p>
<p>The body is swathed in new white cotton cloth,
leaving the face uncovered. A piece of gold or silver
is placed between the teeth to serve as ferry-money
over the Buddhist Styx&mdash;the terrible river of death
which all deceased persons are compelled to pass. This
river is clearly the counterpart of the Vaitara&#7751;&#299; of the
Hind&#363;s (see &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 297).</p>
<p>If the dead man&rsquo;s family is poor, a copper coin or
even a betel nut will suffice. Next the monks are sent
for, their immediate presence being necessary to keep off
the evil spirits who always swarm near a corpse. After
an interval the body is placed in a coffin, which is sometimes
gilded and placed on a bier under a canopy.
When the right day arrives for the funeral, a long procession
is formed, with a number of priests in proportion
to the amount of alms bestowed, and a crowd of relations,
friends, and neighbours. Occasionally those who
carry the bier stop and go through a sort of solemn
dance, while mournful tunes are played by the musicians
and funeral dirges are sung. The body is finally
buried in a cemetery to the west of the town or village.
A funeral must never go to the north or to the east.
The ceremony concludes by alms to the priests, who in
<span class="pb" id="Page_369">369</span>
return intone the commandments and other portions of
the Law in P&#257;li. After the funeral, great festivities go
on in the family-abode for the benefit of the crowds
who come to offer condolence. Then the presence of the
priests is again needed, and has to be paid for by alms
to the monastery, or the evil spirits, who are sure to
hang about, cannot be got rid of. In some parts of
Burma the cremation of rich laymen is not uncommon,
and the ashes are either deposited in D&#257;gabas&mdash;that is,
in small St&#363;pas or Pagodas<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a>&mdash;or are pounded into paste
and made into miniature St&#363;pas (<a href="#Page_506">p. 506</a>) or into small
images of the Buddha for worship at the domestic altar.</p>
<p>In Tibet and Mongolia the corpses of the laity,
especially of the poor, are often exposed in the fields,
in deserts, or on mountain tops, or rocks, or in lonely
ravines, or sometimes in open places enclosed for the
purpose. Occasionally they are covered with a thin
layer of earth or loose stones. Usually they are devoured
by vultures, dogs, and other animals.</p>
<p>It seems that in Lh&#257;ssa certain dogs are kept for
that purpose<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a>. A class of professional men exist there,
whose business it is to cut up dead bodies, and throw
the flesh piecemeal to dogs and vultures. Even the bones
are sometimes pounded, and the dust, being mixed with
flour, is given to be devoured. The strange thing is,
that this kind of burial is thought desirable, and even
honourable. To be eaten up by sacred dogs after death
<span class="pb" id="Page_370">370</span>
is productive of great merit, and leads to re-birth in
higher forms. Dogs are the mausoleums of Lh&#257;ssa.</p>
<p>According to M. Huc, a common funeral ceremony
among the Mongols consists in carrying the corpse to
the summit of a mountain, or to the bottom of a ravine.
The body is walled up in a sort of kiln of a pyramidal
form, with a small door at the bottom, and an opening
at the top to maintain a current of air, and allow the
smoke to escape. During the combustion the L&#257;mas
recite prayers. When the corpse is consumed, the kiln
is demolished. Then the bones are collected and carried
to the Grand L&#257;ma, who reduces them to a powder,
and, after adding an equal quantity of wheaten flour,
kneads the whole carefully, and, with his own hands,
fashions a number of cakes of various sizes. These
are afterwards placed in a pyramidal St&#363;pa, which has
been built beforehand in some auspicious place.</p>
<p>The soil of the famous monastery of the Five Towers
in the province of Shan Si, is said to be so holy that
those interred there are sure to effect a good transmigration.
In the deserts of Tartary, Mongols are frequently
seen carrying on their shoulders the bones
of their kindred, and journeying to the Five Towers&mdash;there
to purchase, almost at its weight in gold, a little
surface of ground whereon to erect a small St&#363;pa.
Some of them undertake a toilsome journey of a whole
year&rsquo;s duration, to reach this holy spot (see <a href="#Page_435">p. 435</a>).</p>
<p>Burial in rivers, which is highly prized by the
Hind&#363;s, is not in favour among Buddhists. Only very
poor people allow their dead to be thrown into rivers,
though this is the only kind of Buddhist burial mentioned
<span class="pb" id="Page_371">371</span>
by Alber&#363;n&#299; (Sachau, ii. 169). Buddhism, from
the first, repudiated the Hind&#363; funeral ceremonies
called &#7776;r&#257;ddhas, which are still a great incubus on the
people. The poorest man in India, if he be of high
caste, cannot perform a &#7776;r&#257;ddha for a relation for a less
sum than forty rupees, given in fees to the priests.
Buddhism did good service in delivering the people
from this burden, but in Northern countries it established
something similar in the Bardo ceremony
(<a href="#Page_334">p. 334</a>).</p>
<h3><i>Formularies of Prayer.</i></h3>
<p>With regard to prayer-formularies, there is in modern
times a good deal of difference between Southern and
Northern Buddhist countries. We have seen that the
three-refuge formulary was the sole prayer of early
Buddhists. Certain orthodox men whom I met in
Ceylon, maintained to me that this is the only legitimate
form of prayer that ought to be used even in the
present day. It is certainly a form which is accepted
and employed by all Buddhists of whatever nationality.</p>
<p>Tsong Khapa, it is said, established at Lh&#257;ssa an
annual prayer-congregation called Monlam &#262;henpo (see
<a href="#Page_386">p. 386</a>). But the most common prayer used in Tibet
is a mere formulary, the constant repetition of which
is one of the most amazing instances of the tyranny of
superstition to be found in any part of the world.</p>
<p>It consists of the six-syllabled sentence, Om ma&#7751;i
padme H&#363;m, &lsquo;Om! the Jewel in the Lotus! H&#363;m!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This prayer, or rather mystical sentence, is supposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_372">372</span>
to have been composed by Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i (Avalokite&#7777;vara),
and to have reference to his own manifestation as the
Patron-Saint of Tibet<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a>. It is sometimes called the
Ma&#7751;i or &lsquo;Jewel&rsquo; prayer, and, if brevity is a valuable
quality, its excellence is undeniable, since it consists
of merely two Sansk&#7771;it words, between two mystical,
untranslatable auspicious ejaculations, Om and H&#363;m<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a>.</p>
<p>Doubtless the prayer really owes its origin to the
close connexion which sprang up between Northern
Buddhism and &#7776;aivism. The worshippers of &#7776;iva have
always used (compare <a href="#Page_240">p. 240</a>) similar mystical sentences
and syllables called Dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#299;s, to which a kind
of miraculous efficacy is attributed. In all probability
an occult meaning underlies the &lsquo;Jewel-lotus&rsquo; formula,
and my own belief is that the majority of those who
repeat it are ignorantly doing homage to the self-generative
power supposed to inhere in the universe&mdash;a
power pointed at by the popular S&#257;&#7749;khya theory
of the union of Prak&#7771;iti and Purusha, and by the universal
worship of the Li&#7749;ga and Yoni throughout
India<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a>. No thoughtful person can have travelled much
in India without being impressed with this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_373">373</div>
<p>At all events, whatever be its origin and meaning,
no other prayer used by human beings in any quarter
of the globe is repeated so often. Every Tibetan believes
it to be a panacea for all evil, a compendium of
all knowledge, a treasury of all wisdom, a summary of
all religion. But if you ask Northern Buddhists to
give you the reason for this belief, very few are able
to give an intelligible reply. According to the most
learned doctors of philosophy who are to be found in
Tibetan monasteries, it is certainly addressed to their
patron deity Avalokite&#7777;vara, and the real secret of its
efficacy lies in the fact, that each one of its six syllables
has a potent influence on some one of the six <i>Gatis</i>
or courses of being&mdash;that is to say, on some one
of the six kinds of transmigration or transformation
through which every living individual has to pass
(see <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>)<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a>.</p>
<p>The oftener, therefore, this mystical formula is repeated
the shorter will be an individual&rsquo;s course (gati)
through some of these six forms of existence, every one
of which involves misery or evil. Or it may be that
by repeating it he will be able to escape some of the
six existences altogether.</p>
<p>Strange indeed as it may appear to us, it is impossible
to shake the faith of a L&#257;mistic Buddhist in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_374">374</span>
absolutely infallible efficacy of his six favourite mystic
syllables. He repeats them, not at all as if he were
praying in a Christian sense, but as if he were a farmer
intent on planting the very best seed in the most productive
soil, and watering it incessantly according to
the most scientific principles of irrigation. A bountiful
harvest is absolutely certain to reward his efforts.</p>
<p>It need not, therefore, surprise us if these six syllables
are murmured morning, noon, and night, by every
man, woman, and child, wherever the L&#257;mistic Hierarchy
has extended. And, if not repeated by the
voice, an incessant stream of repetition&mdash;an incessant
scattering of the six mystic seeds&mdash;is kept going by
the hand.</p>
<p>The words are written or printed on roll within roll
of paper and inscribed in cylinders, which, when made
to revolve either by educated monks or by illiterate
laymen, have the same efficacy as if they were actually
said or repeated. The revolutions are credited as so
much prayer-merit, or, to speak more scientifically, as
so much <i>prayer-force</i>, accumulated and stored up for
the benefit of the person who revolves them.</p>
<p>The cylinder is generally made of metal, the prayer
being engraved on the outside, as well as written on
paper and inserted inside. It is held in the right hand
and whirled round, like a child&rsquo;s toy, by means of a
handle in a particular direction (with the sun). If
made to revolve the other way, its rotations will be set
down to the debtor rather than the creditor side of the
owner&rsquo;s account. Here is a drawing of one of several
hand-cylinders (commonly called prayer-wheels or
<span class="pb" id="Page_375">375</span>
prayer-mills; Tibetan, &#262;hos-kor or &#262;hos-kyi or Khor-lo),
obtained by me at D&#257;rj&#299;ling:&mdash;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/i375.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="488" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Then, again, the words of the prayer are written or
printed millions and millions of times on rolls or strips
of paper, and enclosed in much larger barrel-like cylinders,
which are set up in temples, chapels, monasteries,
corridors, passages, houses, villages, by the road side,
and in every possible corner, for the convenience of the
mass of the people who are too ignorant to read, and
too indolent to engage in continuous oral repetition<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a>.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that quarrels arise from rival
claims in regard to the use of such prayer-cylinders.
In illustration of this an amusing story is told by the
French missionaries:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_376">376</div>
<p>One day when they happened to be passing a praying-machine,
set up near a monastery, they saw two
L&#257;mas engaged in a violent quarrel; and, as it appeared,
all on account of their zeal for their prayers.
The fact was that one L&#257;ma had come, and, having
set the barrel in motion for his own benefit, was retiring
modestly and complacently to his own abode,
when happening to turn his head to enjoy the spectacle
of the wheel&rsquo;s pious revolutions, he saw the other L&#257;ma
stop it, and set it whirling again for himself. Indignant,
of course, at this unwarrantable interference with
his own devotions, he ran back, and in his turn put a
stop to his rival&rsquo;s piety, and both of them continued
this kind of demonstration for some time, till at last
losing patience they proceeded to menaces, and then to
blows, when an old L&#257;ma came out of a neighbouring
cell, and brought the difficulty to a peaceful termination
by himself twirling the prayer-barrel for the
benefit of both parties.</p>
<p>On the occasion of my visiting D&#257;rj&#299;ling in 1884, I
was desirous of judging for myself of the method of
using these remarkable instruments of religion. I
therefore, soon after my arrival, walked to a Buddhist
temple near the town. There I found several large
barrel-like cylinders set up close together in a row at
the entrance, so that no one might pass in without
giving them at least one twirl, or by a rapid sweep of
his hand might set them all twirling at once. Inside
the entrance-portico a shrivelled and exceptionally
hideous old woman was seated on the ground. In her
left hand she held a small portable prayer-cylinder,
<span class="pb" id="Page_377">377</span>
which she kept in perpetual revolution. In her right
hand was a cord connected with a huge barrel-like
cylinder, which with some exertion she made to rotate
on its axis by help of a crank, while she kept muttering
<i>Om ma&#7751;i pamme H&#363;m</i> (so she pronounced it) with
amazing rapidity. In this way she completed at least
sixty oral repetitions every minute, without reckoning
the infinite number of rotatory repetitions accomplished
simultaneously by her two hands. And all this was
done with an appearance of apathy and mental vacuity
in her withered face, which was so distressing and
melancholy to behold, that the spectacle will never be
effaced from my memory. In truth the venerable dame
seemed to be sublimely unconscious that any effort of
thought or concentration of either mind or heart was
needed to make prayer of any value at all.</p>
<p>And the men of Tibet are quite as much slaves to
this superstition as the women. A friend of mine when
staying at D&#257;rj&#299;ling had some conversation on serious
subjects with an apparently sensible native, and observed
with surprise that all the while he was engaged
in talking with the Buddhist, the latter continued diligently
whirling a prayer-cylinder with great velocity.
My friend, being unacquainted with Tibetan customs,
came away from his colloquy under the impression that
Buddhists regard Christians as dangerous lunatics possessed
with evil spirits, which require specially active
measures in the way of exorcism. It did not occur
to him that the Buddhist was merely intent on redeeming
every instant of time for the purpose of storing
up merit by prayer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_378">378</div>
<p>And the hold which this extraordinary superstition
has upon the population is still more forcibly impressed
on the traveller who penetrates into the regions beyond
D&#257;rj&#299;ling. He may there see immense prayer-cylinders
set up like mills, and kept in incessant revolution, not
by the will or hand of man, but by the blind, unconscious
force of wind and water.</p>
<p>It is even said that great mechanical ingenuity is
displayed by the monks in some parts of Tibet, their
inventive powers being stimulated by a burning desire
to economize time and labour in the production of
prayer-merit by machinery.</p>
<p>An intricate arrangement of huge wheels and other
wheels within wheels, like the works of a clock, is connected
with rows of cylinders and made to revolve
rapidly by means of heavy weights. An infinite number
of prayers are repeated in this manner by a single monk,
who takes a minute or two to wind up the complicated
spiritual machinery, and then hastens to help his
brothers in industrial occupations&mdash;the whole fraternity
feeling that the ingenious contrivance of praying by
clock-work enables them to promote the common weal
by making the most of both worlds. The story goes
that, in times of special need and emergency, additional
weights are attached to the machinery, and, of course,
increased cogency given to the rotatory prayers. It
is to be hoped that when European inventions find
their way across the Him&#257;layas, steam-power may not
be pressed into the service of these gross superstitions.</p>
<p>The use of prayer-wheels of various kinds is also common
in Japan, as described in Sir Edward Reed&rsquo;s work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_379">379</div>
<p>But praying by machinery is not all. Beneficial results
are believed to accrue through the carving of the
all-powerful six syllables on every conceivable object.</p>
<p>The traveller, as he walks along, sees the mystic
words impressed on the stones at his feet, on rocks,
doors, monuments, and trees. Indeed, rich and zealous
Buddhists maintain at their own expense, companies of
L&#257;mas for the sole object of propagating the Ma&#7751;i-padme
formula. These strange missionaries may occasionally
be encountered, chisel and hammer in hand, traversing
field, hill, dale, and desert, their only mission being to
engrave the sacred six syllables on every rock in their
path (Huc, ii. 194).</p>
<p>Absolutely incalculable is the grand total of Ma&#7751;i-padmes
thus placed to the credit of the world of living
beings during the short space of twenty-four hours.
Yet, at the end of the New Year&rsquo;s festival in Tibet, the
chief L&#257;ma will sometimes pretend to proclaim the
exact sum of mystic syllables supposed to have been
repeated during its continuance, amounting perhaps to
billions upon billions, for the consolation of all those
faithful Buddhists who, oppressed by the evils of life,
are seeking for some antidote.</p>
<p>But the &lsquo;jewel-lotus&rsquo; is not the only antidote. There
are other short prayer-formularies, such as Om Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i-H&#363;m
(addressed to the Bodhi-sattva Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i,
<a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>), and other still more mystical ejaculations (such
as Om ah H&#363;m); and magical sentences, called Dh&#257;ran&#299;,
and profoundly significant monosyllables, such as Ram,
Pha&#7789;, H&#7771;im, H&#7771;&#299;m, &#7770;im, &#7770;&#299;m, H&#7771;&#299;s.</p>
<p>And here in connexion with the ubiquity of prayer-formularies,
<span class="pb" id="Page_380">380</span>
we must not omit to notice the <i>Praying-walls</i>,
that is, the long stone walls or banks called (from
the &lsquo;jewel-lotus&rsquo; prayer inscribed upon them) <i>Ma&#7751;i</i><a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a>,
or in the provincial dialect Man Dang (variously Man-dong,
Mendong).</p>
<p>These remarkable stone-structures, peculiar to L&#257;mism,
are erected by the side of high-roads, and in
frequented thoroughfares, with the simple object of
aiding in the accumulation of prayer-merit. Some are
only a few feet long, six feet high, and from six to
twelve feet broad; others have been met with nearly
1000 yards long, with pyramidal St&#363;pas<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a> or &#262;aityas
(in Tibetan &#262;hortens) at each end. Inserted in these
walls are slabs on which the six-syllabled, and other
prayer-formulas, and sometimes images of saints, are
carved and dedicated as votive offerings. Passing
travellers acquire merit by keeping them on their left
side<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a>, so that they may follow the letters of the inscription
without necessarily repeating the words<a class="fn" id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a>.</p>
<p>In the same connexion we may advert to <i>Praying-flags</i>
and <i>Praying-staffs</i>. And I may mention that, while
staying at D&#257;rj&#299;ling, I visited a village to which a monastery
is attached, and, on approaching the spot, was
surprised to see the whole neighbourhood studded with
poles from which long flags were flying. On the tops
<span class="pb" id="Page_381">381</span>
of the poles were curious ornaments like caps, made of
coloured cloth with flounces. I naturally supposed
that I had arrived on a gala day, and that at least a
great L&#257;ma or other high functionary was expected,
perhaps to lay the first stone of some new building
connected with the monastery. On inquiry, however,
I ascertained that there was nothing unusual about the
appearance of the village, which was merely praying,
according to custom, by means of its flag-staffs. Every
time the wind, which happened to be blowing fresh,
extended the long flags, a vast number of prayers were
credited to the inhabitants who were themselves all
absent, and probably hard at work either in the fields
or at D&#257;rj&#299;ling.</p>
<p>I managed to obtain facsimiles of some of the flags.
On them are inscribed various versions of the inevitable
Ma&#7751;i-padme formulary, together with figures of
the &lsquo;flying-horse&rsquo; (Lungta, strictly rLu&#7749;-rta, &lsquo;wind-horse&rsquo;)<a class="fn" id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a>
and other symbols, such as those of the Norbu
gem<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a> and of the Phurbu&mdash;which are held to be peculiarly
efficacious in warding off evil spirits or neutralizing
the diseases inflicted by them. Indeed in most
cases these flags are regarded by the peasantry as
talismans or charms to protect the village from the
malice of mischievous ghosts and demons, believed to
haunt the atmosphere and swarm everywhere around.</p>
<p>Here are some of the mystic formularies inscribed on
<span class="pb" id="Page_382">382</span>
my flags. They resemble &#7776;aiva Mantras and Dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#299;s&mdash;that
is, mystical words or sentences used as spells:&mdash;</p>
<p>Om ma&#7751;i padme H&#363;m Hring, Om Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i H&#363;m,
Om &#257; H&#363;m, Om V&#257;g-&#299;&#7777;var&#299; M&#363;m, Sarva-siddhi-phala
H&#363;m, Om muni muni mah&#257;-muni, &#7776;&#257;kya-muni sv&#257;h&#257;,
Om vajra-sattva H&#363;m, Hulu hulu, Rulu rulu, H&#363;m
Pha&#7789;, etc. (Compare my &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism,&rsquo; etc. p. 197).</p>
<p>One flag in my possession has representations of four
animals at the four corners, viz. a Tiger, Lion, Eagle, and
Dragon<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a>&mdash;supposed to act as guards against evil spirits.
It also has an inscription in Tibetan which was translated
for me by Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Reverence be to the Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas! Thus hath it
been heard by me&mdash;once on a time when the adorable &#7776;&#257;kya-Buddha
was seated on a marble throne amid the gods of the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a
heaven, Indra, the Prince of Gods, arrived there, after being completely
defeated by the demons (Asuras). Seeing the Buddha, and throwing
himself at his feet, he thus reverentially addressed him:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, my
Lord, we the gods of the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a (heaven) have suffered a complete
defeat at the hands of the demons; instruct us, what are we to
do? how are we to triumph over our enemies?&rdquo; To this the adorable
one replied:&mdash;&ldquo;O lord of gods, take this mystical formula called
Gyatshar gyi tsemoi Punggyan, which, when repeated, will make you
unconquerable. I, too, in my former existence of a Bodhi-sattva
found it efficacious in securing victory.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is of course a work of great merit to erect prayer-flags.
They form a conspicuous feature in every landscape
throughout Tibet, fluttering on hills and in valleys,
by the roadside, and on the river bank, on walls and on
the tops of houses, in streets, squares, and gardens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_383">383</div>
<p>Then, again, the duty of a constant repetition of
prayer-formul&aelig; and mystical sentences has led Northern
Buddhists to employ <i>Rosaries</i>, which were used both by
Hind&#363;s and Buddhists long before they came into vogue
in Europe. Without these necessary aids to devotion
the long rounds of repetition could not be accurately
completed. In Northern Buddhist countries rosaries
ought to consist of 108 beads, which in Tibet are said
to represent the 108<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a> volumes of the Kanjur. The
same number of beads is used by the worshippers of
Vish&#7751;u, who use the rosary to aid them in repeating
any one of the names of Vish&#7751;u 800 times, the eight
additional beads marking each century of repetitions.</p>
<p>The commonest Buddhist rosaries are made of
wood, or pebbles, or berries, or bone<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a>; the more costly,
of turquoise, coral, amber, or silver, or even of pearls
and gems. If a rosary made of the bones of some holy
L&#257;ma can be procured, it is of course prized above all
others. Sometimes a Dorje is appended. Northern
Buddhist worshippers hold their rosaries (like Roman
Catholics) in the right hand, and move on the beads
with the left, and they will do this while talking
together or even quarrelling. In China and Japan
Buddhist rosaries are often arranged in two rings.
They sometimes consist of enormous beads with relics
in the central bead.</p>
<p>Be it observed, however, that the prayer-formularies
<span class="pb" id="Page_384">384</span>
of Buddhists are not always a mere unintelligible string
of words and syllables, muttered, iterated, and reiterated
with the aid of rosaries. Their prayers sometimes contain
lofty sentiments. For instance, the two vagabond
mendicant monks seen by me at D&#257;rj&#299;ling (described at
<a href="#Page_267">p. 267</a>) went about chanting the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reverence to all the noble Father-L&#257;mas! I address this to the
feet of Duang our patron saint. I, Milaraspa<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a>, sing it. If the soul be
white (enlightened), it must be white inside and outside. I am born
in consequence of the works of this world. My earthly father is a
sower of the seed of sin. My mother is the soil which receives the
seed of sin. The child is myself tied to the father by the cord of sin.
When you think of your earthly father, think also of your L&#257;ma
(spiritual father). Your earthly father is the source of your sin.
Your L&#257;ma frees you from sin<a class="fn" id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this song, which was repeated over and over
again, invariably concluded by a repetition of the inevitable
six-syllabled formula. This they repeated
very rapidly, pronouncing it as usual, &lsquo;Om ma&#7751;i-pamme
H&#363;m,&rsquo; and adding the mystical syllable H&#7771;&#299;s. Their
chanting was accompanied by an incessant agitation of
their &#7693;amaru or sacred drum, which I was able to purchase.
It is shaped like two hemispheres, joined on their
convex sides, and is encircled by sacred shells. It is
sounded by means of buttons attached to two pendulous
strips of leather. The sound made by these drums is
out of all proportion to their size. It may be heard at
a great distance, and is thought to be highly efficacious
in frightening away evil spirits, who dislike loud noises
<span class="pb" id="Page_385">385</span>
of all kinds. Here is an exact representation of the
sacred drum now in my possession:&mdash;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/i385.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="722" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Again, Dr. Eitel (Lectures, iii.) mentions a manual of
daily prayer used by Northern Buddhists, which shows
that striking words are sometimes chanted, though they
may be in Sansk&#7771;it, and therefore unintelligible to those
who repeat them. For instance, the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May all the Buddhas abide in me, instruct and enlighten
me with knowledge and perfection, free me,
deliver me, cleanse me, purify me; and may the whole
universe be set free (Sarva-tath&#257;gat&#257; m&#257;&#7747; sam&#257;vasantu
buddhy&#257; siddhy&#257; bodhaya vibodhaya mo&#263;aya vimo&#263;aya
&#7777;odhaya vi&#7777;odhaya samanta&#7747; mo&#263;aya)!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_386">386</div>
<p>Before, therefore, concluding this Lecture we must
acknowledge, in fairness to the inhabitants of Tibet,
that much of the spirit of religion may be mingled with
their superstitions. The words of their prayers are not
merely repeated by machinery, written on paper, and
inscribed on rocks and stones. The voices of men and
women, if not their thoughts, often go heartily with
uttered prayers. The note of prayer is raised at all
times and seasons&mdash;in the morning, mid-day, and evening,
in private and in public, at home or abroad, in the midst
of labour and idleness, in lying down and rising up, in
moving about and keeping still, on the march and on
the battle-field, on mournful occasions, and in the midst
of joy and laughter. Nor is any one ashamed of praying
aloud or praying together in the open streets and squares
of crowded towns.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There exists,&rsquo; says the French Missionary (ii. 194),
&lsquo;a very touching custom at Lh&#257;ssa. In the evening,
just as the day is verging on its decline, all the Tibetans
stop business and meet together, men, women, and
children, according to their sex and age, in the principal
parts of the town and in the public squares. As
soon as groups are formed, every one kneels down, and
they begin slowly and in undertones to chant prayers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The religious concerts produced by these numerous
assemblages create throughout the town a solemn harmony,
which operates forcibly on the soul. The first time
we witnessed this spectacle, we could not help drawing
a painful comparison between this pagan town, where all
prayed together, and the cities of Europe, where people
would blush to make the sign of the cross in public.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_387">387</div>
<h2 id="c19">LECTURE XIV.
<br /><i>Sacred Places.</i></h2>
<p>It was only to be expected, that Buddhism, closely
connected as it was with Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,
and yet in some respects opposed to those systems,
should have certain sacred places and hallowed regions,
some of which were identical with those of Br&#257;hmanism
and Hind&#363;ism, and some peculiarly its own.</p>
<p>In the Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na-sutta (V. 16-22, Rhys
Davids), we have the following declaration:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;There are four places which the believing man should visit as a
pilgrim with feelings of reverence and awe. The place at which he
can say, &ldquo;Here the Tath&#257;gata (one of the names of Buddha, see <a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>)
was born.&rdquo; The place at which he can say, &ldquo;Here the Tath&#257;gata
attained to perfect insight and enlightenment.&rdquo; The place at which
he can say, &ldquo;Here the Law was first preached by the Tath&#257;gata.&rdquo;
The place at which he can say, &ldquo;Here the Tath&#257;gata passed finally
away in that utter passing away which leaves nothing whatever
behind&rdquo; (see <a href="#fn_61">p. 142, note</a>, and <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>).</p>
<p>&lsquo;And they who die, while with believing heart they journey on
such pilgrimages, shall be reborn, in the happy realms of heaven.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese traveller, F&#257;-hien, names the same four
sacred places (Chap. xxxi.), and says that the situation
of the four great St&#363;pas (see <a href="#Page_504">p. 504</a>) has been fixed,
namely, (1) where the Buddha was born, (2) where he
attained wisdom, (3) where he began to turn the wheel
of his Law, (4) where he attained Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a (<a href="#Page_142">p. 142</a>).
Compare engraving of sculpture opposite <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_388">388</div>
<p>Elsewhere F&#257;-hien mentions two other sacred spots&mdash;the
place where the Buddha discomfited the advocates
of erroneous doctrines<a class="fn" id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a>, and the place where he descended
after ascending to the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a heaven
(see <a href="#Page_414">p. 414</a> of this volume), to preach the Law to his
mother (Legge&rsquo;s F&#257;-hien, 68).</p>
<p>These places are all situated within the area of the
sacred land of Buddhism (see map opposite <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>);&mdash;that
is to say, the land which was the scene of the
Buddha&rsquo;s itineration for forty-five years&mdash;a region about
300 miles long, by nearly 200 broad, lying in Gangetic
India, within the modern provinces of Oudh and Beh&#257;r
(Bih&#257;r for Vih&#257;ra), or the ancient kingdoms of Kosala
and Magadha, and having &#7776;r&#257;vast&#299; and Buddha-Gay&#257;
for its limit towards the north and south respectively.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to note a few particulars in
regard to these and other sacred spots scattered throughout
this region, in the following order:&mdash;Kapila-vastu,
Buddha-Gay&#257;, S&#257;rn&#257;th near Benares, R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha,
&#7776;r&#257;vast&#299; (often written &#7776;r&#257;vasti), Vai&#7777;&#257;l&#299;, Kau&#7777;&#257;mbi,
N&#257;landa, Sa&#7749;k&#257;&#7777;ya, S&#257;ke&#7789;a (Aj&#363;dhy&#257;), Kany&#257;-kubja
(Kanauj), P&#257;&#7789;ali-putra (Patn&#257;), Kesar&#299;ya, Ku&#7777;i-nagara.
The map opposite <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a> will make these clear.</p>
<p>To begin with the Buddha&rsquo;s birth-place (see <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>).</p>
<h3><i>Kapila-vastu.</i></h3>
<p>Kapila-vastu (in P&#257;li, Kapila-vatthu) was long searched
for by arch&aelig;ologists in vain, but is now identified by
<span class="pb" id="Page_389">389</span>
General Sir A. Cunningham and Mr. Carlleyle with
Bh&#363;ila, a village surrounded by buried brickwork in the
Bast&#299; district under the Nep&#257;l mountains, about twenty-five
miles north-east from Faiz&#257;b&#257;d, twelve north-west
from Bast&#299;, and one hundred and twenty north of Benares.
Both F&#257;-hien (Legge, 67) and Hiouen Thsang
describe the neighbouring Lumbin&#299; (Lava&#7751;&#299;) garden,
where the Buddha was born from the right side of his
mother (see <a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>, and engraving opposite <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>). They
also mention the Arrow-fountain where Gautama contended
with others of his tribe in a shooting-match. The
legend is (<a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>) that he gained the victory by shooting
an arrow which passed through the target, buried itself
in the ground, and caused a clear spring of water to flow
forth (Legge, 65-67; Beal, ii. 23, 24). This name &#7776;ara-K&#363;pa,
&lsquo;arrow-fountain,&rsquo; has now been corrupted into Sar-Kuia
(or Sar-Kuhiya), and the spot has been identified
(Cunningham&rsquo;s &lsquo;Reports of Survey,&rsquo; xii. 188).</p>
<p>It might have been expected that so sacred a place
as Kapila-vastu&mdash;the birth-place of Buddha and the
scene of his education and youthful exploits&mdash;would
have been a favourite place of pilgrimage for Buddhists
through all time; but we learn from the two
Chinese travellers, that even in their day (from the
fourth to the seventh century) the whole neighbourhood
was a desert and the town in ruins (Beal, i. 50; ii. 14).
The reason probably is that Hind&#363;ism gained the ascendancy
over Buddhism in certain localities, and that when
this happened the Br&#257;hmans took pains to obliterate all
traces of the rival creed. In later times Muhammadan
invasions contributed to the same result.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_390">390</div>
<h3><i>Buddha-Gay&#257;.</i></h3>
<p>This was the place where the Buddha obtained perfect
knowledge and enlightenment after his sexennial
course of fasting and meditation (see <a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a> of this volume).
It is situated six or seven miles from the town of Gay&#257;,
and about sixty miles from Patn&#257; and Bankipur. It is
of all Buddhist sacred places the most sacred, and
abounds in profoundly interesting memorials of early
Buddhism.</p>
<p>Of course it was only to be expected that memorial
structures intended to mark important epochs in the
life of the extinct Buddha, and calculated to foster feelings
of reverence in the minds of his followers, should
have been erected at this and various other holy spots
of ground consecrated by the presence and acts of
Gautama on great occasions. And of all such Buddhist
monuments the ancient pyramidal temple at Buddha-Gay&#257;,
which I visited in 1876 and 1884, is the most
striking and full of interest. Probably a monument
of some kind was erected there not very long after the
Buddha&rsquo;s death, and Hiouen Thsang (see <a href="#Page_399">p. 399</a>)
mentions the temple built there by A&#7777;oka. The
temple which I saw on the occasion of my first visit
was probably not built till the middle of the second
century, but was erected on the foundation of A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s
temple, the ruins of which are traceable under the
present one<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a>. The materials consist of bluish bricks,
plastered with lime. Hiouen Thsang states that in his
time it had eleven stories and an altitude of about 165
feet. It also had niches in each story, with a golden
statue of Buddha in each niche. The whole was crowned
with the representation of an Amalaka fruit (Emblic
myrobalan) in gilt copper (Cunningham&rsquo;s Report, i. 5).
The Burmese probably restored the temple between
1035 and 1078 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Though falling into decay in 1876,
its appearance struck me as exceedingly imposing,&mdash;even
more so than that of the grand pyramidal towers,
built over the entrances to the great South Indian
temples<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a>. The annexed engraving of this ancient
monument as it appeared in 1880, before its restoration,
is from a photograph by Mr. Beglar, taken on the spot,
and enlarged by Mr. Austen.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">ANCIENT BUDDHIST TEMPLE AT BUDDHA-GAY&#256;, AS IT APPEARED IN 1880.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="center">Erected about the middle of the second century over the ruins of A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s temple, at the spot where Gautama attained Buddhahood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_391">391</div>
<p>The original object of its erection seems to have been
simply and solely to serve as a monument, and not as
a D&#257;gaba or receptacle for relics. Very soon, however,
monuments of this kind were made to enshrine images,
and were used as temples and places of worship. On
inquiry I found that the ancient image or images of
Buddha, which once occupied the shrine in the ancient
Buddha-Gay&#257; temple, had been destroyed or carried
off at different times<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a>, and that another stone image,
believed to have been carved in the eighth century, had
been recently substituted for it. It is remarkable that
<span class="pb" id="Page_392">392</span>
during the process of restoring the so-called &lsquo;diamond
throne,&rsquo; on which the statues were placed, a mass of
fragments of coral, sapphire, cornelian, crystal, ruby,
pearl, ivory, and gold, but no diamond, was found compacted
or cemented together in front of it<a class="fn" id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a>.</p>
<p>At the back of the raised terrace which surrounded
the ancient temple was a P&#299;pal or sacred fig-tree, fabled
to be the very tree under which Gautama sat during
his course of profound meditation ending in Buddhahood
(see <a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>). Its vitality was on the wane, for its
decaying branches drooped over the parapet as if they
sought, like those of a neighbouring Banyan tree, to
gain new life by rooting themselves in the ground
beneath. Some Buddhist pilgrims happened, at the
moment of my visit, to be worshipping at the temple,
deputed by the King of Burma to present offerings.
I observed that they had brought packets of gold-leaf,
and had gilded the stone steps that surrounded the tree.
Having performed this act of homage, they sat near
muttering their prayer-formularies. No doubt they
believed it to be the very Bodhi-tree of Gautama&rsquo;s
time, the stem of which had been miraculously preserved,
though, had it been really so, the stem would
have been about twenty-three centuries old. Considering
the well-known properties of the P&#299;pal tree, it is
possible that the worshippers were, after all, paying
honour to the descendant of the original tree, the
fact, no doubt, being that as each tree began to
decay a new one was produced, by the dropping of
seeds into the old roots and the springing up of fresh
scions. Probably most of the sacred trees in the
neighbourhood of Buddhist temples throughout India,
Ceylon, and Burma were originally raised from seeds
brought from the ancient Buddha-Gay&#257; tree.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/i393.jpg" alt="ANCIENT BUDDHIST TEMPLE AT BUDDHA-GAY&#256;, AS RESTORED IN 1884." width="500" height="778" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">ANCIENT BUDDHIST TEMPLE AT BUDDHA-GAY&#256;, AS RESTORED IN 1884.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_393">393</div>
<p>It is a received tradition that a shoot from this tree
was taken by the Missionary Mahendra, son of A&#7777;oka,
in the third century <span class="small">B.C.</span> to Ceylon, and planted at
Anur&#257;dha-pura, where its descendant still flourishes.</p>
<p>When I again visited Buddha-Gay&#257; in 1884, I found
that the old pyramidal temple had been restored according
(as is conjectured) to Hiouen Thsang&rsquo;s description
of the Vih&#257;ra of his day.</p>
<p>It is said that the late Burmese government, not
very long ago, spent about thirty thousand rupees
in building a wall round the temple and making
excavations with a view to its restoration. Then our
government, about 1881 or 1882, undertook the work,
and I believe at least a lakh of rupees has been spent in
completing it. I give a representation of the restored
temple (as it appeared in 1884), from a photograph taken
by Mr. Beglar, and enlarged by Mr. Austen. Its present
height is 176 feet, as it has several tiers of the usual umbrella-like
ornament, tapering to a point at the summit<a class="fn" id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a>.</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the temple led of course to
the removal of the sacred Bodhi-tree, but an effort was
made to preserve the tree by transplanting it to a
neighbouring garden. No sooner was this done than
parties of pilgrims from Burma and Ceylon, in their
pious desire to maintain the vitality of the venerated
tree, covered the stem with gold-leaf, and, bringing
<span class="pb" id="Page_394">394</span>
Eau de Cologne and other scents, poured them
over the roots, at the same time manuring them with
the contents of boxes of sardines steeped in oil, choice
biscuits, and other delicacies. Of course, the result was
the speedy destruction of the tree, root and branch. To
compensate for its loss, a new P&#299;pal tree was planted
behind the restored temple by Sir A. Cunningham in
1885. Another near the temple appeared to be in a
flourishing condition in 1884, and I observed that both
Hind&#363; and Buddhist pilgrims met together there as
worshippers of the same sacred object.</p>
<p>The idol-shrine, under the principal tower of the restored
temple, consists of a small vaulted stone-chamber
lighted only by the door. My first act, on arriving at
Gay&#257; in 1884, was to descend to this interesting
spot. At the further end is the principal statue of
Buddha, seated, in the &lsquo;witness-attitude&rsquo; (see <a href="#Page_480">p. 480</a>)&mdash;on
an altar-like throne having five pilasters, and supposed
to represent the original Bodhi-ma&#7751;&#7693;a. The pedestal of
the statue is ornamented with diamond-shaped carvings,
and sculptures of two elephants and two lions<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a>.</p>
<p>Inside the shrine, at the moment of my visit, were
five Burmese pilgrims from Mandelay. They were apparently
monks, as all were habited in yellow dresses.
Each man bowed down before the image, with hands
joined in reverence, occasionally touching the ground
with his forehead, and going through a course of prayer-repetition
by help of a rosary. After worshipping for
some time, they deposited a quantity of offerings, of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_395">395</span>
somewhat miscellaneous description, in front of the
image. I noticed among other things, rice, fruit, vegetables,
flowers of the Bel-tree, tin boxes filled with
sardines, Huntley and Palmer&rsquo;s biscuits, bottles of the
genuine Maria Farina&rsquo;s Eau de Cologne for watering
the sacred-trees, and a large number of packets of
gold-leaf. I left the shrine for two or three hours, and
on returning found that the pilgrims had crowned their
act of worship by gilding the image with the contents
of these packets, reserving a supply for covering the
other images in the vicinity of the temple. The cost
of the whole process must have been considerable.</p>
<p>At the back of the great Buddha-Gay&#257; temple, I
found a stone tablet for offerings, recently brought and
fixed horizontally in the ground by another pilgrim who
was from Colombo in Ceylon. It bore an inscription indicating
that the slab had been placed there as a votive
offering by a person calling himself Gu&#7751;a-ratna Muddali
R&#257;j&#257; of Kolamba-pur. The date carved on it (Buddha-vasse
2427) shows that the Buddhists of Ceylon are no
believers in the researches of modern scholars. They still
reckon from <span class="small">B.C.</span> 543 for the supposed Nirv&#257;&#7751;a of Buddha.</p>
<p>At a little distance in front of the great Temple, but
on the right side, are the two smaller temples called
T&#257;r&#257;-dev&#299; and V&#257;g&#299;&#7777;var&#299;. In the latter is a circular
stone with nine circles of complicated ornaments. This
is called a Vajr&#257;sana, from the thunderbolt ornament in
the second circle, but it is not the true Bodhi-ma&#7751;&#7693;a.</p>
<p>I may mention here that a portion of the original
A&#7777;oka stone-railing, with an inscription, lotus-ornaments
and carvings, was discovered in a fair state
<span class="pb" id="Page_396">396</span>
of preservation by Sir A. Cunningham, and is now
to be seen <i>in situ</i>. The Buddha&rsquo;s walking place
was unearthed by Mr. Beglar. The massive new brick
railing which now encloses the temple has been well
constructed after an ancient pattern, and ornamented
with numerous carvings representing scenes in the
lives of the Buddha (<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>). The paved quadrangle
sets the whole off to great advantage. Indeed, the
present appearance of the square and the sacred
area of ground adjoining&mdash;strewn with ruins of the
St&#363;pas erected by A&#7777;oka and others&mdash;and according
to the legend by the gods Indra and Brahm&#257;&mdash;is
one of the most striking sights in all India, and
must be seen to be appreciated.</p>
<p>In truth, Buddha-Gay&#257; is a kind of Buddhist Jerusalem,
abounding in associations of thrilling interest,
not only to the followers of Buddha, but to all who see
in that spot the central focus whence radiated a system
which for centuries has permeated the religious thought
of the most populous regions of Eastern Asia, and influenced
the creed of a majority of the human race.</p>
<p>Another remarkable characteristic of this spot is that
it was converted into a kind of Buddhist Necropolis,
teeming with the remains of generations of the Buddha&rsquo;s
adherents contained in relic-receptacles called St&#363;pas
(pp. <a href="#Page_503">503</a>-506), some of which have been brought to light,
while countless others still remain to be unearthed.</p>
<p>The fact was that immense numbers of pilgrims from
all parts of India and the outlying countries once
thronged in crowds to Buddha-Gay&#257;, and nearly every
pilgrim brought with him a St&#363;pa or relic-shrine
<span class="pb" id="Page_397">397</span>
of some kind, according to his means, and deposited it
as a votive offering in this hallowed region, either with
the object of acquiring religious merit for himself, or of
promoting the welfare of the deceased in other states of
being. Often it was inscribed with the usual Buddhist
formula, Ye Dharm&#257;, etc. (see <a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>), and sometimes
bore a date and the name of the reigning king. Generally
the votive St&#363;pa contained the relics of deceased
relatives&mdash;perhaps the ashes of a father or mother, or
pieces of bone, or a small fragment of a single bone
placed in an earthen vessel or casket of some other
material, and buried in the interior of the St&#363;pa.</p>
<p>Relics, however, were not always forthcoming, and
so the votive St&#363;pas were frequently mere cenotaphs or
models in clay or stone of actual St&#363;pas erected in
other places. Often they were beautifully carved and
ornamented with rows on rows of images of the
Buddha. I obtained some beautiful specimens for the
Indian Institute at Oxford, a drawing of one of
which will be given (see <a href="#Page_505">p. 505</a>). Layers on layers
of these have been exhumed during the process of
the excavations. They are of every variety of size,
from three inches to several feet high, and of every
variety of material, from terra cotta and clay turned
on a potter&rsquo;s wheel to elaborately sculptured brick
and stone. All the upper layers are now gone
(those made of clay and pottery having naturally
crumbled to pieces), but the lowest are still <i>in situ</i>, and
furnish specimens of all ages from the second century
to the tenth or twelfth. I noticed hundreds lying about
on the ground in 1884.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_398">398</div>
<p>A sacred tank, mentioned by Hiouen Thsang, is
situated three or four hundred yards to the left of the
Buddha-Gay&#257; temple. I found, on visiting it, that this
hallowed pool is quite as much venerated by Hind&#363;s as
by pilgrims from Buddhist countries.</p>
<p>Indeed, I was much struck by the evidence which
Buddha-Gay&#257; affords of the inter-relationship between
Buddhism and Hind&#363;ism&mdash;especially that form of the
latter called Vaish&#7751;avism. For instance, on one side of
the temple I noticed the tombs of the Mahants, or Heads
of the neighbouring Hindu monastery, who are buried
there in a sitting posture. Near these again are shrines
of the five P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava heroes (who take the place of the
five Buddhas), and a shrine containing the supposed
impression of the two feet of Vish&#7751;u. The upper
portion of a small Buddhist St&#363;pa has been sawn off
and inverted<a class="fn" id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a>, and Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s footsteps carved on the
smooth surface. This certainly symbolizes in a remarkable
manner the merging of Buddhism in Vaish&#7751;avism,
and bears out Dr. Sachau&rsquo;s assertion that in Alber&#363;n&#299;&rsquo;s
time Vish&#7751;u-worship was dominant in India.</p>
<p>Then, again, on the right of the entrance to the principal
temple is a raised platform of earth, on which are
images of Vish&#7751;u, &#7776;iva, P&#257;rvat&#299;, and Ga&#7751;e&#7777;a. Here I
saw a &#7776;r&#257;ddha ceremony<a class="fn" id="fr_197" href="#fn_197">[197]</a>, in the act of being performed
by some Hind&#363;s&mdash;just arrived from the neighbouring
town of Gay&#257;. They were repeating their mantras,
<span class="pb" id="Page_399">399</span>
offering their Pi&#7751;&#7693;as, and putting the finishing stroke
to the funeral services (previously performed by them
at the Vish&#7751;u-pad temple at Gay&#257;), under the shadow of
a P&#299;pal tree, held as sacred by them as by Buddhists.</p>
<p>To give an exhaustive account of the objects crowded
together at this fountain-head of Buddhism would be
impossible. The following abbreviated version of the
Rev. S. Beal&rsquo;s translation (ii. 115) of Hiouen Thsang&rsquo;s
description, throws great light on the state of Buddhism
in the seventh century:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Going south-west from Mount Pr&#257;gbodhi, we came to the Bodhi-tree.
It is surrounded by a brick wall, and is about 500 paces round.
Within the wall the sacred traces touch one another in all directions.
In one place there are St&#363;pas, in another place Vih&#257;ras. In
the middle of the enclosure is the Bodhi-tree, under which is the
diamond throne called Bodhi-ma&#7751;&#7693;a. On this the Buddha sat and
attained the holy path of perfect wisdom. When the earth is shaken,
this spot alone is unmoved. In old days, when Buddha was alive,
the Bodhi-tree&mdash;which is a Pippala or sacred fig-tree&mdash;was several
hundred feet high. Although it has often been injured by cutting,
it is still forty or fifty feet high. The leaves never wither either in
winter or summer, but always remain shining and glistening, except
on every successive Nirv&#257;&#7751;a-day, when the leaves fade, and then in
a moment revive as before. On this day thousands and ten thousands
assemble from different quarters, and bathe the roots with scented
water and perfumed milk. King A&#7777;oka, before he was converted,
tried to destroy the tree by force, and after him king Sa&#7777;&#257;&#7749;ka tried
again, but the roots sprang up as full of life as ever.</p>
<p>To the east of the Bodhi-tree, there is a Vih&#257;ra about 160 or 170
feet high, built of blue tiles covered with chunam; all the niches in
the different stories holding golden figures. The four sides of the
building are covered with ornamental work. The whole is surmounted
by a gilded copper Amalaka fruit. To the right and left
of the gate are niches; in the left is a figure of Avalokite&#7777;vara Bodhi-sattva
and in the right a figure of Maitreya. On the site of the
present Vih&#257;ra, A&#7777;oka at first built a small Vih&#257;ra. Afterwards a
<span class="pb" id="Page_400">400</span>
Br&#257;hman, who became a convert to Buddhism, reconstructed it on a
larger scale.</p>
<p>To the north of the Bodhi-tree is the place where Buddha walked
up and down, about 70 paces or so long. When he had obtained
enlightenment, he remained perfectly quiet for seven days. Then
rising, he walked up and down during seven days to the north of
the tree. Not far to the south of the tree is a St&#363;pa about 100 feet
high, built by King A&#7777;oka. To the east of the tree is the place
(marked by two St&#363;pas) where M&#257;ra tempted Gautama to become
a Universal Monarch. To the north-west is a Vih&#257;ra in which is an
image of K&#257;&#7777;yapa Buddha, noted for its miraculous qualities. Occasionally
it emits a glorious light, and the old records say, that if
a man, actuated by sincere faith, walks round it seven times, he
obtains the power of knowing the place and condition of his previous
births. Outside the south gate is a large tank, about 700 paces
round, the water of which is clear and pure as a mirror. To the
east of this is the lake of the Snake-king, Mu&#263;alinda. On the west
bank is a small Vih&#257;ra. Formerly, when Tath&#257;gata acquired complete
enlightenment, he sat here for seven days in perfect composure,
and ecstatic contemplation, while Mu&#263;alinda protected him with his
folds wound seven times round his body. (Compare the frontispiece.)</p>
<p>By the side of the river, not far off, is the place where Buddha
received the rice-milk, and where two merchants offered some wheat-flour
and honey from their travelling-store (<a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a> of this volume).</p>
<p>Near this a St&#363;pa marks the spot where the four Kings presented
Buddha with four golden dishes. The Lord declined such costly
offerings. Then the four Kings, casting away the golden vessels,
offered silver ones; and afterwards vessels of crystal, lapis-lazuli,
cornelian, amber, ruby, and so on in succession; but the Lord of
the World would accept none of them. Lastly, the four Kings
offered stone vessels.</p>
<p>Near this spot the Buddha worked various wonders to convert
those who were capable of conversion. For example, it was here
that the Buddha overcame the fiery snake-demon (see <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a> of this
volume). In the middle of the night the N&#257;ga vomited forth fire and
smoke, and the chamber seemed to be filled with fiery flames; but
the Buddha having forced the fiery dragon into his alms-bowl, came
forth next day holding it in his hand, and showed it to the unbelievers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_401">401</div>
<p>To the south of Mu&#263;alinda&rsquo;s tank is a St&#363;pa, which indicates the
spot where K&#257;&#7777;yapa, having embarked in a boat to save Buddha
during an inundation, saw the Lord of the World walking on the

<h3><i>S&#257;rn&#257;th near Benares.</i></h3>
<p>The city of Benares (Ban&#257;ras, properly V&#257;r&#257;&#7751;as&#299;) is the
most sacred place of Br&#257;hmanism<a class="fn" id="fr_198" href="#fn_198">[198]</a>, and is certainly the
second most holy place of Buddhism. For it was from
this centre that the stream of Buddhist teaching first
flowed, and in the days of A&#7777;oka and of his immediate
successors, Buddhism must have vied with Br&#257;hmanism
in the number of its shrines and sacred objects collected
there.</p>
<p>We have already seen that memorial St&#363;pas and
temples, not intended to contain relics, were reared at
various holy spots of ground, consecrated by the presence
of Gautama on special occasions. The immense ruined
St&#363;pa&mdash;once a tower-like monument&mdash;at a spot now
called S&#257;rn&#257;th (S&#257;ra&#7749;ga-n&#257;th<a class="fn" id="fr_199" href="#fn_199">[199]</a>), three or four miles from
the modern city of Benares, is a memorial of this kind.
It is all that remains of the celebrated structure erected
<span class="pb" id="Page_402">402</span>
at the spot in the M&#7771;iga-d&#257;va or deer-park, once called
Isi-patana (for Sansk&#7771;it &#7770;ishi-patana), where Gautama
first turned the wheel of the Law (Dharma-&#263;akra)&mdash;that
is, where he preached his first sermon (<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>). It was
to this place that Buddhist pilgrims once flocked, and
here vast numbers of votive relic-shrines and St&#363;pas
were deposited, as at Buddha-Gay&#257;.</p>
<p>I visited this ancient ruin, in company with the late
Mr. Sherring, in 1876, and enjoyed the advantage of his
guidance in inspecting it, as well as all that remains of
the monastic buildings and other adjacent ruins, including
the octagonal tower called Chaukandi, about half a
mile distant. In his book on Benares, Mr. Sherring has
followed General Sir A. Cunningham, who describes the
principal monument&mdash;now of a bee-hive shape, and
called Dhamek<a class="fn" id="fr_200" href="#fn_200">[200]</a>&mdash;as 93 feet in diameter at the base,
292 feet in circumference, and 128 feet above the
general level of the soil. The lower part&mdash;to a height
of 43 feet&mdash;is built of stone, and all the upper part of
bricks. There are eight projecting faces with empty
niches, which once held statues.</p>
<p>An old man who was in charge of the ruins when
we examined them, lighted a candle, and took us into
the horizontal tunnel-like gallery which the General
had excavated some years before, in the hope that relics
or memorials of some kind might be found buried in
the interior. A shaft or well had been previously sunk
from the summit, and at the depth of 10&frac12; feet a slab
<span class="pb" id="Page_403">403</span>
was discovered, inscribed with the well-known Buddhist
formula &lsquo;Ye dharm&#257;,&rsquo; etc. (<a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>); but the search for
relics proved unsuccessful. The St&#363;pa, in fact, turned
out to be merely memorial, like that at Buddha-Gay&#257;.</p>
<p>Probably some monumental St&#363;pa existed here from
the earliest times, and certainly from A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s time. The
present St&#363;pa was seen by Hiouen Thsang, who has described
it in rather a confused manner (Beal, ii. 45).
Hence it must be as old as about the ninth century.
F&#257;-hien saw a St&#363;pa of some kind there in the fifth century
(<a href="#Page_387">p. 387</a>).</p>
<p>About fifty yards from the St&#363;pa, Sir A. Cunningham
found the interesting sculpture given at <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>.</p>
<h3><i>R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha.</i></h3>
<p>R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha (P&#257;li, R&#257;ja-gaha) is the modern R&#257;j-g&#299;r.
The old city had the epithet Giri-vraja, &lsquo;surrounded by
hills<a class="fn" id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a>.&rsquo; It was the first metropolis or mother-city of
Buddhism, and the original capital of the powerful
kingdom of Magadha, when under the rule of the Kings
Bimbi-s&#257;ra (<a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>) and his son Aj&#257;ta-&#7777;atru, who were
contemporaries and friends of Gautama, and converted
<span class="pb" id="Page_404">404</span>
by him to Buddhism<a class="fn" id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a>. The sacred character of the place
is attested by the ruins of vast numbers of Buddhist
St&#363;pas and Vih&#257;ras which once existed here. Unhappily
Br&#257;hmans and Musalm&#257;ns have used the materials
for their temples, tombs, and mosques.</p>
<p>It was here that Gautama first studied under the
Br&#257;hmans &#256;&#7735;&#257;ra and Uddaka (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>), and here he first imbibed
the philosophical ideas which afterwards coloured
his teaching. It is not surprising, therefore, that at
a later period of his career he was fond of returning to
R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha for retirement during Vassa; his two favourite
resorts<a class="fn" id="fr_203" href="#fn_203">[203]</a> being the Bambu grove (Ve&#7735;u-vana, <a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>) and
the hill called Vulture-peak (G&#7771;idhra-k&#363;&#7789;a, Legge&rsquo;s
F&#257;-hien, 81, 83), both in the neighbourhood of the city.</p>
<p>It was here, too, that several interesting incidents in
the life of Buddha occurred. For example, it was here
in a cavern that the Buddha often meditated. It was
here that he often preached and taught; and it was
here, or in the neighbourhood of the city, that the god
&#7776;akra (Indra) once appeared to Buddha, bringing a
musician from heaven to entertain him, and afterwards
testing his knowledge by forty-two questions. These
the god traced with his finger on the rock, and the impression
of them, according to F&#257;-hien, was to be seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_405">405</span>
there in his time, and a monastery was built on the spot.
With reference to this legend we may note that the
answers to the forty-two questions are supposed to be
contained in a celebrated Tibetan work called the
&lsquo;Forty-two points on which the Buddha gave instruction<a class="fn" id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a>&rsquo;,
the importance of which is proved by its being
translated into several languages.</p>
<p>It was in this neighbourhood, too, that Buddha&rsquo;s two
chief disciples&mdash;&#7776;&#257;riputra and Maudgaly&#257;yana (P&#257;li,
Moggall&#257;na, <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>)&mdash;had their noted meeting with A&#7777;vajit
(P&#257;li, Assaji), already mentioned (<a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>). Here,
also, a Jaina ascetic made a pit of fire and poisoned the
rice, and then invited Buddha to eat. Lastly, it was
here that many of Deva-datta&rsquo;s plots against the
Buddha&rsquo;s life (see <a href="#Page_52">p. 52</a>) were carried on. The story of
these is so interesting that I abridge it from the Sacred
Books of the East (vol. xx. p. 238):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now at that time the Venerable One was seated preaching the
Law and surrounded by a great multitude, including the king and
his retinue. And Deva-datta rose from his seat, and said, &lsquo;The
Venerable One is now aged, he has accomplished a long journey, and
his term of life is nearly run. Let the Venerable One now dwell
at ease and give up the Sa&#7749;gha to me, I will be its leader.&rsquo; Then
said the Buddha, &lsquo;I would not give over the Sa&#7749;gha, even to S&#257;riputta
and Moggall&#257;na; how much less then to so evil-living a person
as you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Deva-datta thought: &lsquo;The Venerable One denies me before
the king, and calls me &ldquo;evil-living,&rdquo; and exalts S&#257;riputta and
Moggall&#257;na.&rsquo; With these thoughts in his mind he departed, angry
and displeased, and went to Aj&#257;ta-sattu and said, &lsquo;Do you, prince,
<span class="pb" id="Page_406">406</span>
kill your father, and become R&#257;j&#257;; and I will kill the Venerable One
and become the Buddha.&rsquo; And prince Aj&#257;ta-sattu, taking a dagger,
entered his royal father&rsquo;s chamber. And the R&#257;j&#257; Bimbi-s&#257;ra said,
&lsquo;Why do you want to kill me, O prince? if you want the kingdom,
let it be thine.&rsquo; And he handed it over to Aj&#257;ta-sattu. Then Deva-datta
said, &lsquo;Give orders, O king, to your men, that I may deprive
the Samana Gotama of life.&rsquo; And Aj&#257;ta-sattu did so. Then sixteen
men were sent to kill Gotama. They went, and returned and said,
&lsquo;We cannot kill him. Great is the power of the Venerable One.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next Deva-datta climbed up the Vulture&rsquo;s Peak, and hurled down
a mighty rock on the Venerable One. But two mountain peaks came
together and stopped that rock. [F&#257;-hien says that it hurt one of
his toes. Legge, p. 83.] Now at that time there was at R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha
an elephant named N&#257;l&#257;giri, fierce and a man-slayer. And Deva-datta
caused the elephant to be let loose against Gotama. But the Venerable
One infused a sense of love into the elephant. And the elephant
extended his trunk and took up the dust from off the feet of the
Venerable One and sprinkled it over his own head, and retired
bowing backwards, gazing upon the Venerable One.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be noted here that the hell to which Deva-datta
was condemned for his attempts upon the Buddha&rsquo;s
life, is thus described by Burmese authorities:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The impious Deva-datta, a cousin and brother-in-law of the Buddha,
suffers terrible punishment in Hell. His feet are sunk ankle-deep
in burning marl. His head is incased with a red hot metal cap
down to the lobe of the ears. Two large red-hot bars transfix him
from back to front, two horizontally from right to left, and one
impales him from head to foot. (Shway Yoe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Burman,&rsquo; i. 121.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be mentioned in connexion with R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha
that Aj&#257;ta-&#7777;atru built a grand St&#363;pa there, over a portion
of the Buddha&rsquo;s ashes, soon after his cremation.</p>
<p>Another fact which enhances the interest of this
place is the propinquity of the celebrated Satta-pa&#7751;&#7751;i
cave (<a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a>), where the Buddhist brotherhood first
assembled after their leader&rsquo;s death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_407">407</div>
<h3><i>&#7776;r&#257;vast&#299;.</i></h3>
<p>&#7776;r&#257;vast&#299; (P&#257;li, S&#257;vatth&#299;), sometimes spelt &#7776;r&#257;vasti,
has been identified by General Cunningham with a place
now called S&#257;het-M&#257;het, about fifty-eight miles north
of Aj&#363;dhy&#257; in Oudh. The town is said to derive its
name from the fact that it was built by a certain King
&#7776;r&#257;vasta. Other native authorities derive it from a
&#7770;ishi named S&#257;vattha, who is said to have resided there.
It was certainly the ancient capital of Kosala (Oudh),
and was ruled over by King Prasena-jit (P&#257;li, Pasenadi),
who was Gautama&rsquo;s contemporary. Moreover, it was
the Buddha&rsquo;s favourite place of retreat<a class="fn" id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a> during the
rainy seasons (<a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a> of this volume), about half of his
Vassas having been spent there<a class="fn" id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a> in the Jeta-vana
monastery built for him by the wealthy merchant
An&#257;tha-pi&#7751;&#7693;ika (Anepidu), sometimes called Su-datta.</p>
<p>Doubtless on this account &#7776;r&#257;vast&#299; was once much
resorted to by the Buddha&rsquo;s followers, and ultimately
became an important seat of Buddhist learning.</p>
<p>The celebrated monastery, the ruins of which still
exist, was erected in the garden (vana) of Prince Jeta,
who parted with the land to Su-datta on condition that
he would cover it with gold coins. This was done, till
eighteen krores of coins had been spread out like a
<span class="pb" id="Page_408">408</span>
pavement on the ground. Both F&#257;-hien and Hiouen
Thsang mention this incident, and the former states
that the monastery was seven stories high<a class="fn" id="fr_207" href="#fn_207">[207]</a>. The pavement
of coins is represented in one of the sculptures
belonging to the St&#363;pa of Bharhut (Cunningham, pp.
84-87), as well as on one of the pillars of A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s railing
at Buddha-Gay&#257;.</p>
<p>&#7776;r&#257;vast&#299; was the place where, according to F&#257;-hien,
the first sandal-wood image of Buddha was set up in a
monastery by King Prasena-jit (see <a href="#Page_471">p. 471</a>)<a class="fn" id="fr_208" href="#fn_208">[208]</a>. A colossal
erect figure of the Buddha was found here in a temple
excavated by Sir A. Cunningham, but this was of stone.</p>
<p>With regard to the celebrated sandal-wood image,
F&#257;-hien (p. 57) relates a strange legend of its preservation
by a miracle:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The kings and people of the countries around vied with one another
in their offerings (to the image). Hanging up about it silken canopies,
scattering flowers, burning incense, and lighting lamps. It happened
that a rat, carrying in its mouth the wick of a lamp, set one of the
canopies on fire, which caught the Vih&#257;ra, and the seven stories were
all consumed. The kings and people were all very sad, supposing
that the sandal-wood image had been burned; but lo! when a
small Vih&#257;ra to the east was opened, there was seen the original
image!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>F&#257;-hien goes on to describe another miracle:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;To the north-west of the Vih&#257;ra there is a grove called &ldquo;The getting
of Eyes.&rdquo; Formerly there were five hundred blind men, who lived
here; Buddha preached his Law to them, and they all got back
their eyesight. Full of joy they stuck their staves in the earth, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_409">409</span>
did reverence. The staves immediately began to grow, and formed
a grove&rsquo; (Legge, pp. 58, 59).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hiouen Thsang states that in his time the towns and
monasteries about &#7776;r&#257;vast&#299; were mostly in ruins. He,
too, gives an interesting account of a miraculous incident
which occurred there:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the north-east of the Jeta-vana garden is the place where the
Buddha washed a sick Monk, who lived apart by himself in a solitary
place. The Lord of the World seeing him inquired, &lsquo;What is your
affliction?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;In former days, my disposition being a
careless one, I never looked on any sick man with pity, and now
when I am sick, no one looks on me.&rsquo; Thereupon the Buddha said
to him, &lsquo;My son! I will look on you,&rsquo; and touching him with his
hand, he healed the sickness. Then leading him forth, he washed
his body, and gave him new clothes, and said, &lsquo;From this time forward
be diligent and exert yourself.&rsquo; Hearing this, the penitent
monk, moved by gratitude and filled with joy, followed the Buddha
and became his disciple. (Founded on Beal, ii. 5, abridged.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i>Vai&#7777;&#257;l&#299;.</i></h3>
<p>Vai&#7777;&#257;l&#299; (in P&#257;li Ves&#257;l&#299;, now Bes&#257;rh) lies twenty miles
north of H&#257;ji-pur, on the left bank of the Ganges, and
twenty-seven north-east of Patn&#257;. This town (the city
of the Li&#263;&#263;havis) is celebrated as the scene of the second
Council (<a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>). Near it, at a place called Bakhra, is a
celebrated ancient pillar surmounted by a lion (see Cunningham,
i. 59). Vai&#7777;&#257;l&#299;, however, is chiefly noted as
one of the places where Gautama often preached and
taught, and where he stopped on his way to Kusin&#257;r&#257;,
the place of his death. His usual residence was in a
Vih&#257;ra, described by F&#257;-hien as double-galleried, and in
a garden presented to him by the courtesan Amba-p&#257;l&#299;,
whom he converted and induced to live a virtuous life.
<span class="pb" id="Page_410">410</span>
He also resided for the fifth year of his teaching in a
building called the K&#363;&#7789;&#257;g&#257;ra<a class="fn" id="fr_209" href="#fn_209">[209]</a> hall.</p>
<p>Hiouen Thsang speaks of the town and of the objects
of interest round it thus (Beal, ii. 66-75):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both heretics and believers are found here living together. There
are several hundred monasteries (Sa&#7749;gh&#257;r&#257;mas) which are mostly
dilapidated. There are also several Deva temples, occupied by sectaries
of different kinds. The followers of the Nirgranthas (i. e. of
the Jains) are very numerous.</p>
<p>To the north is a St&#363;pa which indicates the place where Tath&#257;gata
stopped and took leave of the Li&#263;&#263;havis, on his way to Ku&#7777;i-nagara
to die. Wishing him to quit the world, M&#257;ra (compare <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>) came
to Buddha and said, &lsquo;You have now dwelt sufficiently long in the
world. Those whom you have saved from the circling streams of
transmigration are as numerous as the sand.&rsquo; The Buddha replied,
&lsquo;No, those who are saved are as the grains of dust on my nail; those
who are not saved are like the grains of dust on the whole earth.
Nevertheless, after three months I shall die.&rsquo; M&#257;ra hearing this was
rejoiced, and departed.</p>
<p>Both within and without the city of Vai&#7777;&#257;l&#299; and all round it, the
sacred vestiges are so numerous, that it would be difficult to recount
them all. To the north-west is a St&#363;pa at the spot where Buddha
dwelt when he recited the history of his former birth (J&#257;taka) as
a &#262;akra-vartin or Universal Monarch (compare <a href="#Page_423">p. 423</a>) possessed of the
seven treasures. To the south-east is a great St&#363;pa, marking the
place where the convocation of the seven hundred sages and saints
was held, one hundred and ten years after the Nirv&#257;&#7751;a of Buddha,
to compel the monks who had broken the laws of Buddha to obey
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that the Li&#263;&#263;havis of Vai&#7777;&#257;l&#299; obtained a
large quantity of the relics of the Buddha&rsquo;s body, and
built a St&#363;pa over them.</p>
<p>According to F&#257;-hien they also erected a St&#363;pa over
<span class="pb" id="Page_411">411</span>
half the relics of the burnt body of &#256;nanda (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>
of this volume), the other being deposited near R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha.
His narrative runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When &#256;nanda was going from Magadha to Vai&#7777;&#257;l&#299;, wishing his
Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a to take place there, king Aj&#257;ta-&#7777;atru heard of his intention,
and set out with his retinue to follow him.</p>
<p>The Li&#263;&#263;havis, too, when they heard that &#256;nanda was coming to
their city, went out to meet him. In this way both parties arrived
together at the river, and &#256;nanda, thinking to himself that he ought
to please both, burnt his own body in the middle of the river, and
thus attained Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a in a fiery ecstasy of Sam&#257;dhi. Then his
body was divided into two, so that each got one half as a sacred relic
(Legge, pp. 75-77).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i>Kau&#7777;&#257;mb&#299;.</i></h3>
<p>Kau&#7777;&#257;mb&#299; (in P&#257;li Kos&#257;mb&#299;), now Kosam<a class="fn" id="fr_210" href="#fn_210">[210]</a>, on the river
Jumn&#257;, about thirty miles from Allah&#257;b&#257;d, was once a
place hallowed by many Br&#257;hmanical associations, and is
mentioned in the R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a. It was the capital of the
Kau&#7777;&#257;mba country, and is said to have been founded
by Ku&#7777;&#257;mba, tenth in descent from Pur&#363;ravas. Without
doubt it was one of the most ancient cities of India. It
was also the city of King Udayana, whose story is
alluded to by the greatest of all Sanskrit poets, K&#257;li-d&#257;sa,
in his &lsquo;Cloud-Messenger<a class="fn" id="fr_211" href="#fn_211">[211]</a>.&rsquo; Furthermore, Kau&#7777;&#257;mb&#299;
is the city in which the scene of the Sansk&#7771;it
drama Ratn&#257;val&#299; was laid<a class="fn" id="fr_212" href="#fn_212">[212]</a>.</p>
<p>The Buddha resided there in the sixth and ninth
<span class="pb" id="Page_412">412</span>
years of his Buddhahood, and probably visited the place
at other times. This was the chief cause of its reputation
in connexion with Buddhism. But it also derived
its sacred character from the fact that it contained the
celebrated sandal-wood image<a class="fn" id="fr_213" href="#fn_213">[213]</a> of the Buddha, believed
to have been carved during his life-time, by a sculptor
sent by Moggall&#257;na (see last line, <a href="#Page_414">p. 414</a>) at King Udayana&rsquo;s
request, to the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a heaven, when the
Buddha was there preaching the Law to his mother
(see <a href="#Page_207">p. 207</a>).</p>
<p>In a village near at hand Sir A. Cunningham (i. 308)
found two sculptured pillars, and the pedestal of a
statue inscribed with the &lsquo;Ye dharm&#257;&rsquo; formula (see p.
104). A great monolith was also discovered there. In
F&#257;-hien&rsquo;s time a Vih&#257;ra existed at the spot where the
Buddha had explained the Law (Legge, p. 96). Hiouen
Thsang mentions that a lofty St&#363;pa, 200 feet high, was
erected by A&#7777;oka near at hand.</p>
<p>There was also a cavern in which the Buddha had
left his shadow impressed on the rock. He also speaks
of ten monasteries all in ruins.</p>
<h3><i>N&#257;landa.</i></h3>
<p>N&#257;landa<a class="fn" id="fr_214" href="#fn_214">[214]</a> was the greatest seat of Buddhist learning
in India. It has been identified by Sir A. Cunningham
with the village of Baragaon, about seven miles north of
<span class="pb" id="Page_413">413</span>
R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha, about thirty miles south-east of the modern
Patn&#257;, and about forty miles from Buddha-Gay&#257;. Sir
Alexander states that Baragaon possesses immense ruins
and more numerous specimens of sculpture than any
other place visited by him. According to Hiouen Thsang,
the Buddha preached the Law there for three months.
The vast extent and importance of the monastery
(Sa&#7749;gh&#257;r&#257;ma) or monasteries at N&#257;landa have been
already alluded to (<a href="#Page_169">p. 169</a>). F&#257;-hien, however, does not
mention them, which seems to indicate that they were
built subsequently to <span class="small">A.D.</span> 425. Hiouen Thsang, who
travelled in the seventh century, is said to have resided
there for five years as a student. Ten thousand monks,
renowned for their learning, lived and studied in six
magnificent buildings. The following is an extract
from the later Chinese traveller&rsquo;s description of it (Beal,
ii. 70):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The monks of N&#257;landa, to the number of several thousands, are
men of the highest ability. Their conduct is pure and unblamable,
although the rules of the monastery are severe. The day is not
sufficient for asking and answering profound questions. From morning
till night the monks engage in discussion; the old and the young
mutually helping one another. Those who cannot discuss questions
out of the Tripi&#7789;aka are little esteemed, and are obliged to hide themselves
for shame. Hence learned men from different cities come here
in multitudes to settle their doubts; and thence the streams of their
wisdom spread far and wide. For this reason some persons usurp
the name of N&#257;landa students, and in going to and fro receive honour
in consequence.</p>
<p>If men from other quarters desire to enter and take part in the
discussions, the keeper of the gate proposes some hard questions;
those who are unable to answer have to retire. One must have
studied deeply both old and new books, before gaining admission.
Those students who come as strangers, have to show their ability by
<span class="pb" id="Page_414">414</span>
hard discussion; those who fail compared with those who succeed
are as seven or eight to ten.</p>

<h3><i>Sa&#7749;k&#257;&#7777;ya.</i></h3>
<p>Sa&#7749;k&#257;&#7777;ya, now called Sa&#7749;kisa, about fifty miles
north-west of Kanouj, was identified by Sir A. Cunningham
in 1842. It was evidently once a large town
with many remarkable monuments, and ought to be
reckoned among the most sacred places of Buddhism.
Hiouen Thsang describes it under the name Kie-pi-tha
(Kapitha).</p>
<p>It is said that the Buddha&rsquo;s mother died seven days
after his birth (see <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a> of this volume), and was thus
deprived of the advantage of hearing the Law from her
son&rsquo;s lips. To compensate her for this loss, the Buddha
ascended by his own supernatural power in three steps
to the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a heaven of Indra (<a href="#Page_207">p. 207</a>), to which
his mother had been transported, and there recited the
Law for three months for her benefit. His return to
earth seems to have been a more difficult matter; for
his descent was not effected without the help of a
ladder with three parallel flights of steps, made for
him by the god Indra.</p>
<p>F&#257;-hien describes this miraculous incident in the following
manner (Legge, 48, abridged):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sa&#7749;k&#257;&#7777;ya is the place where Buddha came down after ascending
to the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a heaven, and there preaching his Law for three
months for his mother&rsquo;s benefit. Buddha had ascended there by his
supernatural power, without the knowledge of his disciples; but
seven days before his return, Anuruddha, by his own supernatural
vision, saw him in heaven, and requested Moggall&#257;na (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a> of this
volume) to ascend to Indra&rsquo;s heaven to inquire after &lsquo;the World-honoured
one.&rsquo; Moggall&#257;na did so, and returned with the information
<span class="pb" id="Page_415">415</span>
that in seven days the Buddha would return. Then the kings
of eight countries with their people, not having seen Buddha for a
long time, were all eagerly looking up for him to return. But the
female mendicant Utpal&#257;<a class="fn" id="fr_215" href="#fn_215">[215]</a> thought in her heart, &lsquo;To-day, the kings,
with their ministers and people, are all going to meet Buddha. I am
but a woman; how shall I succeed in being the first to see him?&rsquo;
Then Buddha, by his supernatural power, changed her into the
appearance of a Universal Emperor, so that she was the foremost of
all to meet and to do reverence to him.</p>
<p>At his descent three flights of steps were created. Buddha descended
on the middle flight, composed of the seven precious substances;
Mah&#257;-Brahm&#257;, king of the Brahm&#257; heavens (see <a href="#Page_211">p. 211</a> of
this volume), came down by a flight of silver steps on the right side,
and &#7776;akra (Indra), lord of the thirty-three divinities (<a href="#Page_207">p. 207</a>), descended
by steps of gold on the left side, holding a canopy made of
the seven precious substances. An innumerable multitude of gods
followed. No sooner had the Buddha come down than all three
flights disappeared in the ground, except seven steps, which continued
to be visible.</p>
<p>Afterwards King A&#7777;oka, being eager to ascertain where their ends
rested, sent men to find out by digging. They dug down till they
reached a yellow spring, but could not discover the bottom of the
steps. Hence the king felt an increase of devotion, and built a
Vih&#257;ra over the steps, with a standing image of Buddha sixteen
cubits high. Behind the Vih&#257;ra he erected a stone pillar, about fifty
cubits high, with a lion on the top of it. A dispute arose between
some heretics and the Buddhist monks about the ownership of the
place, and the former agreed to give up their claim if any supernatural
sign occurred; upon which the lion on the column gave
a great roar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>F&#257;-hien adds that a St&#363;pa was erected on the spot
where Buddha descended; another where the female mendicant
caught the first sight of Buddha at his descent.</p>
<p>The basement of King A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s pillar was found by
General Cunningham in 1876. On a previous occasion
<span class="pb" id="Page_416">416</span>
he discovered the capital of the ancient pillar surmounted
by an elephant, which may have been mistaken
by F&#257;-hien for a lion (see Cunningham, i. 274).</p>
<p>Hiouen Thsang, in his account of the three ladders
(Beal, i. 202), says that they were arranged side by side
from north to south, so that those who descended might
have their faces to the east, and that the flight by which
Indra descended was of crystal (not of gold), while that
used by Brahm&#257; was of silver, and the Buddha&rsquo;s steps
were of gold (or of the seven precious substances, of
which gold was one). This indicated the superiority of
Buddha over the two gods who accompanied him.</p>
<p>In harmony with these ideas Indra and Brahm&#257; are
sometimes represented in Buddhistic sculptures standing
one on each side of the Buddha, and protecting him.
They were also present at his birth (see <a href="#Page_483">p. 483</a> and
engraving opposite <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>).</p>
<p>Hiouen Thsang adds that some centuries before his
time the ladders still existed in their original position;
but, when he visited the spot, they had sunk into the
earth, and disappeared. Sa&#7749;k&#257;&#7777;ya, however, was still
much frequented. A magnificent image of the Buddha
was preserved in a large monastery there, and 1000
priests were studying the doctrines of the Sammat&#299;ya,
a school of the H&#299;na-y&#257;na, in four monasteries. Furthermore,
many &lsquo;myriads&rsquo; of pious laymen lived in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The story of Buddha&rsquo;s descent from heaven by help
of golden steps is commonly believed both in Ceylon and
Burma to the present day. The legend, as current in
Ceylon, is given by Spence Hardy (Manual, p. 311).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_417">417</div>
<p>It appears that when Buddha was about to return to
earth from the god Indra&rsquo;s heaven, the god reflected
that, although Buddha had ascended in three steps, his
descent ought to be celebrated &lsquo;with special honours.&rsquo;
He therefore caused a ladder of gold to extend from the
Mountain Meru (see <a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a> of the present Lectures) to
Sa&#7749;k&#257;&#7777;ya, 80,000 Yojanas<a class="fn" id="fr_216" href="#fn_216">[216]</a> in length. The steps were
alternately of gold, silver, coral, ruby, emerald and other
gems. At the right side of the ladder he created
another, also of gold, by which Indra, blowing the conch,
descended, accompanied by his own gods; and on the
left another ladder of silver, by which Brahm&#257; and the
Brahm&#257; gods (<a href="#Page_210">p. 210</a>) descended, holding umbrellas
over the Buddha. The three flights of steps appeared
to the people of the earth like three rainbows. When
Buddha commenced his descent all the worlds were
illuminated by the light from his body.</p>
<p>With this extravagant myth&mdash;believed in as a historical
fact by most Buddhists&mdash;we may contrast the
simple narrative of Jacob&rsquo;s dream in Genesis xxviii.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the legend is curious, and I was greatly
pleased by discovering in the Indian Section of the
South Kensington Museum, a small bronze model of the
triple ladder, lately dug up at Moulmein. Mr. Purdon
Clarke, C.I.E., the present Keeper, kindly had the model
photographed, and presented me with a drawing of it.
This I have had engraved, and here give.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_418">418</div>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/i418.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="567" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>It will be observed that an image of the Buddha
is represented above the ladder, as if seated in Indra&rsquo;s
heaven, and as if engaged in the act of teaching there;
while the earth is typically represented below in the
shape of a square platform, with four small Buddhist
temples, one at each of the four quarters of the compass
(compare <a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>).</p>
<p>A ruder representation of the ladder occurs in the
sculptures of the Bharhut St&#363;pa (Cunningham, p. 92).
<span class="pb" id="Page_419">419</span>
The General found an imperfect representation of it
carved in soap-stone at Sa&#7749;kisa in 1876 (Report, xi. 26).</p>
<h3><i>S&#257;keta.</i></h3>
<p>S&#257;keta is a name of the ancient city Ayodhy&#257; (now
Aj&#363;dhy&#257;) described in Valm&#299;ki&rsquo;s great epic the R&#257;m&#257;yan&#7751;a,
and believed to have been founded by Manu,
the progenitor of the human race. This renowned city,
which was a great centre of Br&#257;hmanism, was also, no
doubt, at one time a considerable centre of Buddhism.
At all events, the identification of certain Buddhist sites
there has been made clear by Sir A. Cunningham, who
considers S&#257;keta to be the same as the Pi-so-kia (Vi&#7777;&#257;kh&#257;)
of Hiouen Thsang and the Sh&#257;-che or Sh&#257;-khe of F&#257;-hien.
The former found twenty monasteries there, and 3000
priests studying the Little Vehicle according to the
Sammat&#299;ya school; also fifty Deva temples and very
many heretics.</p>
<p>In one of the monasteries resided the Arhat Deva-&#7777;arm&#257;,
who wrote a treatise called the Vij&ntilde;&#257;na-k&#257;ya-&#7777;&#257;stra
in defence of the doctrine of the non-existence
of any Ego or personal self. A St&#363;pa, 200 feet high,
was built by A&#7777;oka in the place where Buddha is supposed
to have preached and taught during six years.</p>
<p>Both F&#257;-hien and Hiouen Thsang mention the legend
that he one day threw on the ground a twig he had
used to clean his teeth (danta-k&#257;sh&#7789;ha), which sprouted
and grew into a miraculous tree seven cubits high, at
which height it always remained. The Br&#257;hmans became
jealous of the miracle and sometimes cut the tree
down, sometimes uprooted it, but it always grew again
<span class="pb" id="Page_420">420</span>
and remained at the same height. Here also is the
place where the four Buddhas (<a href="#Page_400">p. 400</a>) walked and sat
(Legge, pp. 54, 55; Beal, i. 240).</p>
<h3><i>Kany&#257;-kubja (Kanouj).</i></h3>
<p>Kany&#257;-kubja<a class="fn" id="fr_217" href="#fn_217">[217]</a> is the Sansk&#7771;it name for the ancient
city of Kanouj; (often spelt Kanoj), once the capital of
Northern India, and said to be the oldest city in India,
next to Ayodhy&#257;.</p>
<p>When Hiouen Thsang visited this place it was the
capital of the celebrated monarch Harsha-vardhana, also
called &#7776;il&#257;ditya (see <a href="#Page_167">p. 167</a> of this volume), whose kingdom
extended from Kashm&#299;r to Assam and from the
river Narbad&#257; to Nep&#257;l. When he carried off a tooth-relic
of the Buddha from Kashm&#299;r, his procession back to
his capital was attended by a large number of tributary
kings. Hiouen Thsang, in describing the piety of this
great monarch, says of him, that &lsquo;he sought to plant the
tree of religious merit to such an extent that he forgot
to sleep and to eat.&rsquo; He goes on to state as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>King &#7776;il&#257;ditya forbade the slaughter of any living thing as food
on pain of death. He built several thousand St&#363;pas, each about
100 feet high. Then in all the highways of the towns and villages
throughout India he erected hospices, and stationed physicians there
with medicines for travellers and the poor persons round about. On
all spots where there were holy traces of Buddha, he built monasteries.
Once in five years he held the great assembly called Moksha. Then
<span class="pb" id="Page_421">421</span>
every year he assembled the monks, and bestowed on them the four kinds
of alms (food, drink, medicine, clothing). He ordered them to carry
on discussions, and himself judged of their arguments. He rewarded
the good and punished the wicked. He promoted the men of talent,
and degraded evil men. Wherever he moved he dwelt in a travelling-palace,
and provided choice meats for men of all sorts of religion. Of
these the Buddhist priests would be perhaps a thousand; the Br&#257;hmans
five hundred<a class="fn" id="fr_218" href="#fn_218">[218]</a>. He divided each day into three portions.
During the first he occupied himself on matters of government;
during the second he practised himself in religious devotion (Beal,
i. 214).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding Hiouen Thsang&rsquo;s description of
various St&#363;pas, monasteries and monuments seen by
him, General Sir A. Cunningham was not able to identify
any of the existing ruins in the neighbourhood
of Kanouj, &lsquo;so completely has almost every trace of
Hind&#363; occupation been obliterated by the Musalm&#257;ns&rsquo;
(Report, i. 284).</p>
<p>F&#257;-hien mentions a St&#363;pa near the town, built on the
spot where the Buddha preached a discourse on &lsquo;the
bitterness and vanity of life,&rsquo; comparing it to &lsquo;a bubble
or foam on water&rsquo; (Legge, 54).</p>
<h3><i>P&#257;&#7789;ali-putra.</i></h3>
<p>P&#257;&#7789;ali-putra (now Patn&#257;) seems to have existed as a
village at a very early period. Its ancient name was
Kusuma-pura. It was enlarged and practically founded
about the time of the Buddha&rsquo;s death by Aj&#257;ta-&#7777;atru<a class="fn" id="fr_219" href="#fn_219">[219]</a>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_422">422</span>
who did not, however, remove there from his own capital
city R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha. One of his successors, the great King
A&#7777;oka, the well-known patron of Buddhism (<a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>),
converted P&#257;&#7789;ali-putra into the metropolis of the kingdom
of Magadha, and it thenceforward became an important
centre of Buddhism. Sir A. Cunningham
states that it continued flourishing as the capital of the
great Gupta kingdom during the fourth and fifth centuries
of the Christian era.</p>
<p>F&#257;-hien relates a tradition that King A&#7777;oka&rsquo;s palace
in the city was built by genii (spirits), who brought
great rocks and constructed chambers by heaping them
together. He describes a monastery belonging to the
Great Vehicle, and a temple belonging to the Little
Vehicle, in the neighbourhood of the city, and gives an
account of a Buddhist procession of four-wheeled cars
and images which took place once a year. Each car
was twenty-two feet or more high, and had five stories,
with niches on four sides, in which were placed images
of the Buddha and the Bodhi-sattvas, along with images
of the gods (d&#275;vas). They were made to look like
moving pagodas (or D&#257;gabas). The Hind&#363;s, as we know,
have similar car-processions to this day, when the images
of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a are dragged through the streets of towns
and villages.</p>
<p>F&#257;-hien mentions the interesting fact that the nobles
of the country had founded hospitals in the city to which
destitute, crippled, and diseased persons might repair,
and receive advice, food, and medicines suited to their
cases, gratuitously. He adds that A&#7777;oka, wishing to
<span class="pb" id="Page_423">423</span>
build 84,000 St&#363;pas<a class="fn" id="fr_220" href="#fn_220">[220]</a> in place of the eight originally
constructed over the Buddha&rsquo;s ashes, built the first
St&#363;pa and a pillar near P&#257;&#7789;ali-putra.</p>
<p>Near it he says was an impression of the Buddha&rsquo;s
foot, over which a temple with a door towards the north
had been erected (Legge, pp. 77-80; Beal, i. lv-lviii).
The position of the St&#363;pa and column has been discovered
by Sir A. Cunningham (xi. 157, 158).</p>
<h3><i>Kesar&#299;ya.</i></h3>
<p>Kesar&#299;ya is a large village about thirty miles distant
from Vai&#7777;&#257;l&#299; (Bes&#257;rh). It is chiefly remarkable for a
mound of ruined brick-work, 62 feet in height, supporting
a solid brick St&#363;pa (nearly 68&frac12; feet in diameter),
which is also partly in ruins. The people call it the
St&#363;pa of the &#262;akravart&#299; (Universal Monarch) Ve&#7751;a,
father of King P&#7771;ithu. In Manu, VII. 41; IX. 66, 67,
King Ve&#7751;a is described as an arrogant monarch who
resisted the authority of the Br&#257;hmans. Probably he
favoured the Buddhists. At any rate the Buddhists
assert that the remarkable St&#363;pa at this place was built
to mark the spot where Gautama Buddha preached a
discourse, in which he described one of his previous
births as a &#262;akravart&#299; king.</p>
<p>Not far from the St&#363;pa a small mound has been
excavated, and the head and shoulders of a colossal
statue of Buddha brought to light (Cunningham, i. 67).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_424">424</div>
<h3><i>Ku&#7777;i-nagara.</i></h3>
<p>Ku&#7777;i-nagara (in P&#257;li Kusi-n&#257;r&#257;) was the place where
the Buddha died, or&mdash;to speak more correctly&mdash;passed
away in Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a (see pp. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, <a href="#Page_49">49</a>, <a href="#Page_140">140</a>). It was long
searched for in vain, but has recently been identified by
Sir A. Cunningham with the modern Kasia, eighty miles
east of Kapila-vastu, and 120 miles N.N.E. of Benares.</p>
<p>Neither F&#257;-hien nor Hiouen Thsang say much about
Ku&#7777;i-nagara, except that it was deserted and had few
inhabitants; but the latter&rsquo;s allusion to the Buddha&rsquo;s
passing away out of the world at this place, and his
account of the subsequent assembling of the first council
at R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha by order of the great K&#257;&#7777;yapa (pp. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>, <a href="#Page_55">55</a>),
is so interesting and curious that I here give an abstract
of his narrative, based on Mr. Beal&rsquo;s translation (ii.
161):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once when the great K&#257;&#7777;yapa was seated in meditation, suddenly
a bright light burst forth, and the earth shook. Then, exerting his
faculty of supernatural vision, he saw the Lord Buddha passing away
into Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a between two trees. Forthwith he ordered his followers
to accompany him to the city of Ku&#7777;i-nagara. On the way
there they met a Br&#257;hman, who, on being asked whence he came, replied,
&lsquo;From Ku&#7777;i-nagara, where I saw your master entering into Nirv&#257;&#7751;a.
A vast multitude of heavenly beings were around him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>K&#257;&#7777;yapa having heard these words said, &lsquo;The sun of wisdom has
extinguished his rays. The world is now in darkness. The illustrious
guide&mdash;the King of the Law&mdash;has left us; the whole world
is empty and afflicted. Men and gods are left without a guide.&rsquo;
Accordingly, he proceeded to the two trees, and looking on Buddha,
offered worship. But certain careless monks said one to another,
with satisfaction, &lsquo;Tath&#257;gata has gone to rest. This is good for us;
for now, if we transgress, who is there to reprove us?&rsquo; Then
K&#257;&#7777;yapa was deeply moved, and resolved to secure obedience to the
teaching of Buddha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_425">425</div>
<p>Addressing the assembled multitude, he said, &lsquo;We ought to collect
the Law. Those who have kept it without failure, whose powers of
discrimination are clear, such persons may form the assembly. Those
who are only learners must depart to their homes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On this they went away, and only 999 men were left, including
&#256;nanda. But the great K&#257;&#7777;yapa excluded &#256;nanda as being yet a
learner. Addressing him, he said, &lsquo;You are not yet free from defect;
you, too, must leave the assembly. You were a personal attendant on
Buddha, you loved him much, and are, therefore, not free from the
ties of affection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So &#256;nanda retired to a desert place. Wearied out, he desired to
lie down. Scarcely had his head reached the pillow, when lo! he
obtained the condition of an Arhat. Then he returned to the door
of the assembly. But K&#257;&#7777;yapa said to him, &lsquo;Have you got rid of
all ties? If so, prove it; exercise your spiritual power and enter
without the door being opened.&rsquo; Then &#256;nanda entered through the
key-hole, and having paid reverence to the assembled monks, sat
down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This power of reducing the body to the size of an
atom, so as to be able to pass through so minute an
aperture as a key-hole, was one of the supernatural
faculties supposed to belong to perfected saints or Arhats
(compare pp. <a href="#Page_133">133</a>, <a href="#Page_245">245</a> of these Lectures).</p>
<p>The consideration of Buddhist Sacred Places might
lead us on to various hallowed spots in other Buddhist
countries, for example, Anur&#257;dha-pura, Adam&rsquo;s Peak
and Kelani in Ceylon; the site of the great pagoda
at Rangoon, and of that near Mandalay in Burma; the
site of the Buddha&rsquo;s foot-print (Phra Bat) in Siam;
the snows of Kinchinjunga in Sikkim; the city of Lh&#257;ssa
and its monasteries in Tibet; Kuren in Mongolia; but
all these, and other places, have either been incidentally
mentioned in previous Lectures or will be more fully
noticed hereafter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_426">426</div>
<h2 id="c20">LECTURE XV.
<br /><i>Monasteries and Temples.</i></h2>
<p>Buddhist monasteries deserve a fuller notice than
the incidental allusions we have made to them in previous
Lectures.</p>
<p>The duty of dwelling under trees, and not in houses,
according to the example set by all the Buddhas (see
<a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a>), and especially by Gautama Buddha himself,
during his long course of meditation (see <a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>), was
in theory supposed to be binding on all true monks.
&lsquo;The root of a tree for an abode&rsquo; was one of &lsquo;the four
Resources,&rsquo; of which every monk was allowed to avail
himself, and the enumeration of which formed part of
the admission-ceremonies (see <a href="#Page_80">p. 80</a>).</p>
<p>At the same time certain dispensations or indulgences
were specially granted at those ceremonies, one
of which was permission to live in covered residences,
when not itinerating. The five kinds of dwellings permissible
under varying circumstances are described in
&#262;ulla-vagga (VI. 1, 2). They are Vih&#257;ras (monasteries),
A&#7693;&#7693;hayogas (i. e. houses of a peculiar shape), storied
dwellings (pr&#257;s&#257;da)<a class="fn" id="fr_221" href="#fn_221">[221]</a>, mansions (harmya), and caves (see
note, <a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a> of this volume).</p>
<p>It is clear that any painful exposure of the body to
<span class="pb" id="Page_427">427</span>
the violent storms of India was incompatible with one
of the principles of Buddhism, which, though it taught
self-denial and self-sacrifice of a particular kind, deprecated
all personal self-inflicted pain and austerity.</p>
<p>Yet it appears (from Mah&#257;-vagga, III. 15) that at the
time of his first residence at R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha (see <a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a> of
these Lectures), the Buddha had not yet instituted &lsquo;the
Retreat&rsquo; during the rains (Vassa). Hence the monks
were in the habit of going on their travels alike during
winter, summer, and the rainy season.</p>
<p>The people complained of this, and said that the
monks in walking about during wet weather were
unable to avoid crushing vegetable life and treading
on minute living things. Thereupon the Buddha prescribed
that the monks were to keep &lsquo;Vassa,&rsquo; and refrain
from peregrination during the rains.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, when the Buddha had left R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha
and had taken up his abode during Vassa in the
Jeta-vana garden at S&#257;vatth&#299; (see <a href="#Page_407">p. 407</a>), a wealthy
and pious layman (Up&#257;saka) who had built a monastery
(Vih&#257;ra) for the monks, sent to invite them to reside in
it, saying that he wished to hear them recite the Law
and to bestow gifts upon them. The Buddha permitted
them to go, but required them to return in seven days.
He gave the same permission when another rich and
pious layman had provided other residences and conveniences
for the monks, such as a storied house, a
mansion, a store-room, a cave, a refectory, a bathing
room, a well-house, a pavilion, a park, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when, on a particular occasion, a
monk wished to keep Vassa in a cattle-pen (Mah&#257;-vagga,
<span class="pb" id="Page_428">428</span>
III. 12) the Buddha permitted him to do so. So,
again, on another occasion he allowed a man to keep
Vassa in a caravan, and on a third occasion in a covered
boat or ship. But it is recorded that he prohibited
Vassa from being kept in the open air, or in the hollow
of trees<a class="fn" id="fr_222" href="#fn_222">[222]</a> (see Mah&#257;-vagga, III. 12, 3).</p>
<p>It is evident from all this, that even in the early
days of Buddhism, rich laymen were in the habit of
seeking to acquire religious merit by providing comfortable
habitations for the monks; and although at
first the use of such luxuries was only permitted in the
rainy season, this restriction was soon removed, and
a residence in covered dwellings became usual at all
seasons of the year.</p>
<p>Then, as Buddhism spread, kings, princes, and rich
men competed with each other for the privilege of
erecting vast monasteries&mdash;sometimes called Vih&#257;ras<a class="fn" id="fr_223" href="#fn_223">[223]</a>,
sometimes Sa&#7749;gh&#257;r&#257;mas&mdash;to which temples, libraries,
and schools were generally attached, and in which dwelt
wealthy communities of monks, who were allowed to
hold property in land.</p>
<p>The founding of extensive and important institutions
of this kind was, of course, an exceptional proceeding.
As a general rule, collections of monastic dwellings were
of a simple and unostentatious character. In various
parts of India are to be seen in the present day ancient
Buddhist cave-monasteries now untenanted, some of
<span class="pb" id="Page_429">429</span>
them&mdash;such as the caves of Bar&#257;bar&mdash;as old as the
third century <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>
<p>I myself visited those at Elor&#257; (Elur&#257;), twelve miles
from Aurang&#257;b&#257;d in the Niz&#257;m&rsquo;s territory, as well as
others at N&#257;sik, K&#257;rle, and other places. The Elor&#257;
caves are possibly as old as the third century<a class="fn" id="fr_224" href="#fn_224">[224]</a>, and
with the adjoining Br&#257;hmanical and Jain caves of later
date, extend for one mile and a quarter along the scarp
of an elevated plateau. The three groups of caves rival
each other in the beauty and interest of their sculptures,
and together constitute one of the wonders of India&mdash;their
position side by side proving that the adherents of
the three systems lived together in harmony. Among
the Buddhist caves are beautiful &lsquo;&#262;aityas&rsquo; or halls for
general worship (see <a href="#Page_450">p. 450</a>), refectories for commensality,
and cells without number for the habitation of
the monks. All the excavations had become partially
filled up; but the visit of the Prince of Wales in 1876
stimulated the Niz&#257;m&rsquo;s government to clear away the
dust and rubbish of centuries.</p>
<p>Then, besides cave-monasteries, the ruins of extensive
monastic establishments built of brick, stone, or other
less durable materials, are scattered everywhere throughout
India.</p>
<p>Those of the vast monastery of N&#257;landa near R&#257;ja-g&#7771;iha,
and others at various other sacred places, have
been already described (see <a href="#Page_412">p. 412</a>).</p>
<p>Turning next to the monastic structures of modern
Buddhist countries, and beginning with Ceylon, we find
<span class="pb" id="Page_430">430</span>
that in that island, as Spence Hardy has pointed out,
and as I myself observed during my sojourn there, the
residences of the monks are of very simple construction,
and often extremely mean in appearance. They are
called P&#257;n-s&#257;l&#257;s (Pa&#7751;&#7751;a-&#7777;&#257;l&#257; = Sansk&#7771;it Par&#7751;a-&#7777;&#257;l&#257;) because
supposed to be made of leaves. In general, however,
they are constructed of wattle filled up with mud,
the roof being covered with straw, or with the platted
leaves of the cocoa-nut. They are always dirty and
always abound in cobwebs.</p>
<p>A monastery which I saw near Kandy consisted of
an oblong rectangular court-yard, surrounded in the
interior by a kind of roofed cloister or verandah, out of
which opened the monks&rsquo; cells, lighted only from the
sky above the court. The interior walls of both cloister
and cells were begrimed with patches of dirt and
masses of cobwebs, which are never touched for fear of
breaking the first Buddhist commandment, &lsquo;kill not&rsquo;
(<a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>).</p>
<p>Of course there are monasteries of a better and more
imposing type, such as that attached to the M&#257;lig&#257;wa
temple of the sacred eye-tooth on the Kandy lake (see
<a href="#Page_454">p. 454</a>).</p>
<p>In Burma the ordinary residences of the monks
appear to be simple in character, like those in Ceylon.
In Siam, on the contrary, they are sometimes elaborate,
and often have richly-covered entrances. At the same
time the Siamese monks (according to Mr. Alabaster)
are in the habit of itinerating a good deal, only remaining
in their monasteries during the three months
of rains, when residence there is imperative.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_431">431</div>
<p>Speaking of the larger and more imposing monasteries
(Kyoung) in Burma, Mr. Scott says (I give his account
in an abbreviated form):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The monasteries are built of teak, or, sometimes in Mandalay and
Lower Burma, of brick. The shape is always oblong, and the
inhabited portion is raised on posts and pillars, eight or ten feet above
the ground. They are, like all the other houses in the country, only
one story high; for if it is an indignity to a layman to have anyone&rsquo;s
feet over his head<a class="fn" id="fr_225" href="#fn_225">[225]</a>, it is much more so to a member of the brotherhood.
The space between the ground and the floor is always kept open, and
is never used except by the monastery school-boys. A flight of steps
of stone or wood leads up to the verandah, which extends along the
north and south sides, and frequently all round. From the raised
floor thus reached, rises the building, with tier upon tier of massive
roofs (in diminishing stages), giving the appearance of many stories
when there is only one. The accommodation is simple. It consists
in the main of a central hall divided into two portions, one level with
the verandah where the scholars are taught, and most of the duties of
the monastery carried on, and the other a dais, raised about two feet
above the level of the rest of the building. Seated upon this, the
monks are accustomed to receive visitors, and at the back, against the
wall, are arranged the images of Buddha, a large one usually standing
in the centre on a kind of altar, with candles, flowers, praying flags,
and other offerings placed before it. On shelves alongside are a number
of smaller figures of gold, silver, alabaster, clay or wood, according
to the popularity of the monastery, and the religious character of the
neighbourhood. Occasionally there are dormitories for the monks,
but as a rule they sleep in the central hall, where the mats which form
their beds may be seen rolled up against the wall. The whole area
of the extensive compound in which the monastery stands is enclosed
<span class="pb" id="Page_432">432</span>
by a heavy teak fence with massive posts and rails, seven or eight feet
high. The laity, when they enter, take off their shoes and carry them
in their hands. This rule applies to the highest in the land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The daily life of the monks inhabiting monasteries
of this kind in Burma has been already described (see
pp. <a href="#Page_311">311</a>-314 of these Lectures).</p>
<p>If we now pass to northern Buddhist countries we
shall find that, as a general rule, the dwellings of monks
are insignificant tenements of poor construction, attached
to or built round small chapels or shrines. Sometimes
the monks live in the rooms built over such chapels.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Temple (Journal, ii. 207) visited a so-called
monastery at Pemyangchi (in Sikkim), which
consisted of a single building with two stories. In the
upper some of the monks resided, and a chapel formed
the lower.</p>
<p>The temple-monastery I myself visited in British
Sikkim, near D&#257;rj&#299;ling, is similar. The exterior appearance
might be compared to that of some small Dissenting
chapel in an English village. The thatched roof,
which once gave it a picturesque appearance, has recently
been removed, and a roof of modern construction
substituted. The shrine or temple is on the ground
floor, while the upper floor is the abode of the attendant
priests, and seems also to serve as a store-room with
cupboards for their equipments. The contents of the
ground-floor temple, with its altar at the further end
and shelves for the sacred books on one side, are very
indistinctly seen, being only lighted up by a &lsquo;dim
religious light,&rsquo; when the door is kept wide open.
I noticed three images on the altar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_433">433</div>
<p>The case is different when large numbers of monks
congregate in particular places. In some districts of
Lad&#257;k, Mongolia and Tibet, monasteries (or L&#257;maseries
as they are sometimes called) have been erected,
which for vastness, magnificence, and grandeur of situation
amid splendid scenery, are unequalled in any
part of the world.</p>
<p>According to strict rule, retired localities should be
chosen. Hence large monastic establishments are often
found in solitary places<a class="fn" id="fr_226" href="#fn_226">[226]</a> and elevated situations; for
instance, in Lad&#257;k those at L&#257;ma Yurru and Hemis are
more than 11,000 feet above the sea, and that at Hanle is
14,000 feet. They resemble romantic castles towering upwards
in the midst of rocks, crags, and snowy mountains.</p>
<p>Another monastery at K&#299;lang (Kyelang), in the
British Tibetan province of Lah&#363;l (contiguous to Lad&#257;k),
stands on the spur of a mountain, at an elevation
of 12,000 feet, and is approached through grand ravines
and glaciers, so that occasionally, after snow-storms,
those who pass to and fro are buried in avalanches.</p>
<p>The outer walls of large monasteries of this kind in
secluded situations are generally lofty. Often they are
made of stone or brick, plastered with mud and surmounted
with little pinnacles and poles, on which are
prayer-flags. Within the walls are cells for the monks,
the abode of the Head or Abbot, a room for holding
books, a temple, an assembly-hall, a refectory, store-houses,
receptacles for musical instruments, masks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_434">434</span>
staves, etc.; the buildings being often arranged in rows,
and always intermixed with St&#363;pas (see <a href="#Page_504">p. 504</a>) and
monuments. The walls of the vestibules and of the
great hall are usually ornamented with fresco-paintings,
representing subjects from the Buddhist J&#257;takas
(<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>). Generally there are corridors or covered cloisters
lined with prayer-wheels, or open walks paved with stone,
called in Sansk&#7771;it &#262;ankrama&#7751;a (P&#257;li, &#262;ankamana), for
the monks to perambulate up and down in meditation.
These are supposed to be constructed after the pattern
of the stone walking-places used by the Buddha himself
(see <a href="#Page_400">p. 400</a>).</p>
<p>In the monastery at K&#299;lang the roof of the great
hall is supported by massive beams garnished with belts,
swords, yaks&rsquo; tails, huge and terrible masks, and all
sorts of odds and ends. On one side is a huge praying-wheel,
on each revolution of which a bell is struck.
A dim subdued light pervades the entire hall, exaggerating
the ghastly hideousness of the figures<a class="fn" id="fr_227" href="#fn_227">[227]</a>.</p>
<p>To take as another instance&mdash;the monastery or
L&#257;masery of Kunbum (or Kumbum) north of Tibet,
celebrated as the birth-place of Tsong Khapa (<a href="#Page_277">p. 277</a>),
and situated, according to M. Huc, on a mountain intersected
by a broad and deep ravine:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On either side of the ravine, and up the slopes of the mountain,
rise, in amphitheatrical curves, the white dwellings of the L&#257;mas,
each with its little terrace and enclosing wall, while here and there
above them &lsquo;tower the temples, with their gilt roofs glittering with
a thousand colours.&rsquo; The houses of the superior monks are distinguished
by pennants, floating above small hexagonal turrets, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_435">435</span>
those of the ordinary monks are simple cells. On all sides mystical
sentences, in the Tibetan character, meet the eye (see <a href="#Page_381">p. 381</a>), some
inscribed on doors, some on walls and stones, or on linen flags fixed
on poles.</p>
<p>Almost everywhere are conical vessels, in which incense and odoriferous
wood are burning; while numbers of L&#257;mas circulate through
the streets of the monastery in their red and yellow dresses&mdash;grave in
their deportment, and, although under no obligation to silence, speaking
little, and that little in a low voice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This L&#257;masery of Kunbum enjoys so great a reputation,
that the worshippers of Buddha make pilgrimages
to it from all parts of Mongolia, Tartary, and Tibet, and
on the occasion of great festivals the confluence of strangers
is immense. It is much frequented by Eastern
Tibetans.</p>
<p>Near Kunbum is a much smaller monastery, devoted
to the study of medicine. It is at the foot of a
rocky mountain, on the heights of which dwell certain
contemplative monks. M. Huc saw one of these hermits,
who never communicated with the outer world except
for food, which he drew up to his rocky cell by the help
of a bag tied to a long rope (ii. 73).</p>
<p>Some mention should also be made of the monasteries
at Kuku khotun, &lsquo;the blue city&rsquo; in Tartary. That town
contains no less than five great L&#257;maseries and fifteen
affiliated monasteries, with a grand total of 20,000
L&#257;mas dwelling in them. The chief monastery is that
of the &lsquo;Five Towers&rsquo;&mdash;not to be confounded with one of
the same name in the Chinese province of Shan si.</p>
<p>This latter is a celebrated place for burials (see p.
370), and pilgrims may there be edified by a sight of
the Buddha&rsquo;s shadow impressed on a rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_436">436</div>
<p>Another example of a monastery in a remote situation
is that of Kurun or Kuren (see <a href="#Page_295">p. 295</a>), situated on the
slope of a mountain in Mongolia. In this celebrated
monastery of the Grand L&#257;ma T&#257;ran&#257;tha 30,000 L&#257;mas
(according to M. Huc) are lodged and supported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The plain at the foot of the mountain is constantly covered with
tents of various sizes for the convenience of pilgrims. Hither throng
the worshippers of Buddha from the most remote countries.</p>
<p>Viewed from a distance, the white cells of the L&#257;mas, built on the
declivity in horizontal lines one above the other, resemble the steps of
an enormous altar, of which the temple of the T&#257;ran&#257;tha L&#257;ma
appears to constitute (in Roman Catholic phraseology) &lsquo;the tabernacle.&rsquo;
In this country T&#257;ran&#257;tha is the saint par excellence, and there is not a
Tartar Khalka who does not take a pride in calling himself his disciple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Passing on now to Tibet, we find that in its principal
provinces the number of monastic institutions connected
with its two respective capitals of Lh&#257;ssa and Tashi
Lunpo, is more than a thousand, with 491,242 L&#257;mas.
This is the estimate of the latest traveller<a class="fn" id="fr_228" href="#fn_228">[228]</a>.</p>
<p>According to Huc, more than thirty large monasteries
may be reckoned in the neighbourhood of Lh&#257;ssa alone.</p>
<p>Adverting for a moment to Lh&#257;ssa itself, we may note
that this &lsquo;city of the gods&rsquo;&mdash;the chief town of the
province of U, situated on the Ki-&#263;hu river<a class="fn" id="fr_229" href="#fn_229">[229]</a>&mdash;had in
1854 about 15,000 inhabitants within a circumference
of two-and-a-half miles. According to a Chinese proverb,
its chief inmates have always been &lsquo;priests, women, and
dogs.&rsquo; Koeppen affirms that Lh&#257;ssa has always been a
greater nest of monk-priests than Rome has ever been.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_437">437</div>
<p>Doubtless its population is now increased, and includes
a considerable proportion of laymen; yet, in all
likelihood, at least two-thirds of the inhabitants are
monks; and it cannot be too often repeated that, according
to the true theory of Buddhism, the only raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre of the laity is to wait upon the monkhood.</p>
<p>Moreover, Lh&#257;ssa, next to Benares and Mecca, is,
perhaps, the most frequented place of pilgrimage upon
earth. Scarcely a day passes on which the streets do
not overflow with crowds of pilgrims&mdash;some from every
quarter of Tibet, some from Bhut&#257;n and other Him&#257;layan
regions, some from all parts of Mongolia. All meet here
to worship the incarnated representative of the Bodhi-sattva
(Avalokite&#7777;vara) manifested in the Dalai L&#257;ma&mdash;to
receive his blessing, his consecrated pills, and his
prayer-papers (see <a href="#Page_331">p. 331</a> of these Lectures). The residence
of this L&#257;mistic Pope is at Potala.</p>
<p>In fact Potala on the north-west side of Lh&#257;ssa is
what the Vatican is to Rome. It existed in ancient
times as a palace, but was rebuilt and converted into a
palace-monastery by the celebrated fifth Dalai L&#257;ma
Navang Lobsang, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1617-1682 (<a href="#Page_292">p. 292</a> of this volume),
and from that time forward became the residence of all
the Dalai L&#257;mas, who had before lived either at Sera
or at Brepung (Dapung, see p. 442).</p>
<p>In its striking and unique position, it is even more
imposing than the Vatican.</p>
<p>Imagine a lofty structure erected on an isolated hill<a class="fn" id="fr_230" href="#fn_230">[230]</a>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_438">438</span>
rising abruptly from the plain with three long summits
or eminences, and watered at the base by the Ki-&#263;hu river,
which flows into the great Tsanpo. The south-western
ridge is the so-called Iron-hill, on which is a monastery
where Tsong Khapa himself is said to have taught.
The north-eastern bears the name of the Phagmo hill<a class="fn" id="fr_231" href="#fn_231">[231]</a>,
while the highest is the hill of Potala, with its palace-monastery
towering in four stories to the height of
about 367 feet, and ending in a cupola covered with
plates of pure gold.</p>
<p>From this vantage ground the incarnated Bodhi-sattva
looks down on the crowds of pilgrims approaching
to worship him, or kneeling at the foot of the
hill. The buildings grouped in the vicinity are said to
contain 10,000 rooms, for the accommodation of as many
monks. Countless are the statues of Buddha, with other
idols and images of saints, not to mention obelisks and
pyramidal monuments, which meet the eye everywhere.
All sacred objects are manufactured out of gold, silver,
or copper, according to the wealth of those who have
brought them as offerings. Two ascending avenues lead
up from Lh&#257;ssa to Potala, which are constantly thronged
with foreign pilgrims, troops of L&#257;mas in official vestments,
<span class="pb" id="Page_439">439</span>
higher L&#257;mas and courtiers in full uniform. Yet
we are told that a solemn religious silence prevails,
for the thoughts of all are fixed in meditation.</p>
<p>I have already given an abstract of Mr. Sarat
Chandra D&#257;s&rsquo; narrative of his visit to Potala, and his
presentation to the Dalai L&#257;ma on June 10, 1882 (see
<a href="#Page_331">p. 331</a> of these Lectures). I now add an account
of Mr. Thomas Manning&rsquo;s interview with the Dalai
L&#257;ma on December 17, 1811. No European, except
Mr. Manning<a class="fn" id="fr_232" href="#fn_232">[232]</a>, has ever set eyes on a Dalai L&#257;ma, and
no other Englishman has ever seen Lh&#257;ssa (for M. Huc
was misinformed; Moorcroft was never there):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We rode to the foot of the mountain on which the palace is built, or
out of which, rather, it seems to grow; but having ascended a few
paces to a platform, were obliged to dismount. From here to the hall
where the Grand L&#257;ma receives visitors is a long and tedious ascent.
It consists of about four hundred steps, partly stone steps in the rocky
mountain, and the rest mere ladders from story to story in the palace.
Besides this, from interval to interval along the mountain, wherever
the ascent is easy, there are stretches interspersed, where the path
continues for several paces together without steps. At length we
arrived at the large platform on which is built the hall of reception.
There we rested awhile, arranged the presents, and conferred with the
L&#257;ma&rsquo;s Chinese interpreter.</p>
<p>The T&iacute;-mu-fu was in the hall with the Grand L&#257;ma. I was not
informed of this until I entered, which occasioned me some confusion.
I did not know how much ceremony to go through with one, before
I began with the other. I made the due obeisance, touching the
ground three times with my head to the Grand L&#257;ma, and once to the
T&iacute;-mu-fu. I presented my gifts, delivering the coin and the handsome
silk scarf with my own hands into the hands of the Grand L&#257;ma.
I then took off my hat, and humbly gave him my clean-shaven head to
<span class="pb" id="Page_440">440</span>
lay his hands upon. The ceremony of presentation being over, the
Munsh&#299; and I sat down on two cushions not far from the L&#257;ma&rsquo;s
throne, and had tea brought to us. It was most excellent, and
I meant to have emptied the cup, but it was whipped away suddenly,
before I was aware of it. The L&#257;ma&rsquo;s beautiful and interesting face
and manner engrossed almost all my attention. He was at that time
about seven years old; and had the simple and unaffected manners of
a well-educated princely child. His face was, I thought, poetically
and affectingly beautiful. He was of a gay and cheerful disposition;
his beautiful mouth perpetually unbending into a graceful smile, which
illuminated his whole countenance. Sometimes, particularly when he
had looked at me, his smile approached to a gentle laugh. No doubt
my grim beard and spectacles somewhat excited his risibility. He
inquired whether I had not met with molestation and difficulties on
the road; to which I promptly returned the proper answer. A present
of dried fruit was brought and set before me, and then we withdrew.
(Mr. Clements Markham&rsquo;s Tibet, p. 264, abridged.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the monasteries grouped around this Vatican
of L&#257;mistic Buddhism, we may make special mention
of four, noting a few particulars.</p>
<p>To begin with the oldest monastery, that of <i>L&#257;
brang</i>, said to mean &lsquo;abode of L&#257;mas<a class="fn" id="fr_233" href="#fn_233">[233]</a>,&rsquo; which was built
by King Srong Tsan Gampo (see <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a> of this volume),
and founded in the seventh century. This ancient
institution is in the very centre of Lh&#257;ssa, and is regarded
as the centre of the whole country. All the
main roads of Tibet converge towards it. Doubtless
the area of the monastery has been enlarged by occasional
additions in the course of one thousand years,
but not since it was partly rebuilt and restored in the
seventeenth century. Its magnificent temple (Cho Khang)
is the St. Peter&rsquo;s of L&#257;mism (see <a href="#Page_459">p. 459</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_441">441</div>
<p>The immense number of monks inhabiting this monastery
is proved by the fact that a huge cauldron is
shown which holds more than 1200 gallons of tea for
the L&#257;mas who perform the daily services.</p>
<p>The other three monasteries near Potala and L&#257;
brang, according to Koeppen, are devoted to the study
of magic and the art of exorcising. We may take them
in the following order:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, at a short distance north of L&#257; brang, stands
the monastery <i>Ramo&#263;he</i>, &lsquo;the great enclosure,&rsquo; which
was the other ancient monastery built by Srong Tsan
Gampo, or by one of his wives (see <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>). It is now
a great school of exorcism, and has a celebrated temple
(see pp. <a href="#Page_462">462</a>, <a href="#Page_463">463</a>), containing the celebrated image of
the Buddha, and also one of Nanda, Gautama&rsquo;s step-brother
and disciple. Those who study here may gain the
decree of &lsquo;Doctor of Magic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next comes the monastery of <i>Moru</i> (or Muru or Meru),
close to the city. It is noted for its order and cleanliness,
and for its printing-press. Like the last, it contains
a school for instruction in magic.</p>
<p>Then, at a short distance east of L&#257; brang (according
to Koeppen), is the monastery of <i>Gar Ma Khian</i>&mdash;the
mother monastery of soothsayers, fortune-tellers, and
exorcisers (&#262;hos-kyong, see <a href="#Page_266">p. 266</a>).</p>
<p>Let us next turn to the three ancient &lsquo;mother-monasteries&rsquo;
of the Yellow sect&mdash;Galdan, Sera, and
Dapung.</p>
<p><i>Galdan</i> (<i>or Gahdan</i>), the &lsquo;heaven of contented beings&rsquo;
(Sansk&#7771;it Tushita, see pp. <a href="#Page_207">207</a>, <a href="#Page_213">213</a>)&mdash;the oldest monastery
of the Yellow sect&mdash;is situated on the hill of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_442">442</span>
same name, about thirty miles<a class="fn" id="fr_234" href="#fn_234">[234]</a> east of Lh&#257;ssa. As
already stated (pp. <a href="#Page_278">278</a>, <a href="#Page_294">294</a>), it was founded by Tsong
Khapa <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1409. It is three-quarters of a mile in circumference,
and has 3300 monks.</p>
<p><i>Sera</i>, &lsquo;the golden,&rsquo; founded by Tsong Khapa (<a href="#Page_278">p. 278</a>),
or by one of his disciples immediately after his death,
lies about three miles north of Lh&#257;ssa, on a declivity of
a hill, over which passes the road leading to Mongolia.
It has 5500 monks, and numerous temples, towers,
and houses curving round like an amphitheatre. On
the hills above the town are rows of cells of contemplative
monks and recluses.</p>
<p>Sera has three great temples several stories high,
the halls of which are richly gilded. In one temple
the staff of Gautama Buddha is preserved.</p>
<p><i>Dapung</i> (variously Dapu&#7749;, Depung, Debung, Debang,
Brepung, Brebung, Prebung), &lsquo;rice-heap,&rsquo; so called from
the shape of the hill, was also founded by Tsong Khapa
three years before Sera, and is situated four miles west
of the city of Lh&#257;ssa. It has 7700 monks. The great
temple in the middle is surrounded by four small ones.
One of these four belongs to the exorcisers and professors
of magical arts, of whom there are nearly three hundred.
In the centre of the monastery is a residence for the
Dalai L&#257;ma, when he pays his annual visit. Numbers
of foreigners study here, especially Mongolians. In
front of the monastery stands a St&#363;pa, which contains
the bones of the fourth Dalai L&#257;ma, Jon Tan Yam Thso,
who was of a Mongolian family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_443">443</div>
<p>Mr. Edgar (Report, p. 41) mentions four other monasteries
of the Yellow sect around Lh&#257;ssa, <i>Chemiling</i>,
<i>Tengiling</i>, <i>Chechuling</i>, and <i>Kenduling</i><a class="fn" id="fr_235" href="#fn_235">[235]</a>. The last is
said to be the residence of the Regent (<a href="#Page_286">p. 286</a> of these
Lectures). Sarat Chandra D&#257;s gives a long list of monasteries,
some containing 5000 monks (e.g. Rnam rgyal
grvatsang, Gongdkar rDorjegdan, etc.) and some 7000.</p>
<p>We have next to describe the great monastery of the
second Grand L&#257;ma of Tibetan Buddhism&mdash;I mean
that at <i>Tashi Lunpo</i>, also belonging to the Yellow
sect.</p>
<p><i>Tashi Lunpo</i>, near <i>Shigatse</i>, is the seat of government
of the Tashi L&#257;ma or Panchen L&#257;ma (see <a href="#Page_284">p. 284</a>
of these Lectures), and the second metropolis of L&#257;mistic
Buddhism. Our knowledge of this celebrated
place is derived from the record of the journeys of
Mr. Bogle and Captain Turner, as well as from the
narratives of Indian explorers.</p>
<p>According to some of these authorities, Tashi Lunpo
is situated about 140 English miles in a nearly
westerly direction from Lh&#257;ssa. It is built on a level
plain enclosed on all sides by rocky hills, through
which a small river (the Painam) rushes into the great
Tsanpo (Brahma-putra). The monastery is said to have
been built by the first Dalai L&#257;ma, Gedun grub pa, in
1445 (see <a href="#Page_291">p. 291</a> of these Lectures), though the final
seat of the Dalai L&#257;mas was at Lh&#257;ssa.</p>
<p>According to Koeppen four roads meet at Tashi
<span class="pb" id="Page_444">444</span>
Lunpo; one leading to Lh&#257;ssa, one to Lad&#257;k, one to
Nep&#257;l, and one to Bhut&#257;n.</p>
<p>Near at hand, on the north-east side of the Tashi Lunpo
monastery, on a rocky eminence protecting it from the
cold winds, stands the fort of Shigatse (also written
Shigatze), which, with its surrounding houses, forms
the capital of the province of Tsang, just as Lh&#257;ssa
constitutes that of the province of U.</p>
<p>Our fellow countryman, Mr. Bogle, commissioned by
Warren Hastings to open communications between
Bengal and Tibet, arrived at Tashi Lunpo in 1774.
His description of it is to the following effect. I give
it abbreviated (from Mr. Clements Markham&rsquo;s Tibet):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We passed by the foot of Tashi Lunpo, which is built on the lower
declivity of a steep hill. The roof of the palace is all of copper-gilt.
The building is of dark-coloured brick. The houses of the town rise
one above another. Four churches with gilt ornaments are mixed
with them. Altogether the town presents a princely appearance.
Many of the courts are spacious, flagged with stone, and have galleries
running round them. The alleys, which are likewise paved, are
narrow. The palace is appropriated to the L&#257;ma and his officers,
to temples, granaries, warehouses, etc. The rest of the town is
entirely inhabited by priests, who are in number about four thousand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is the substance of Mr. Bogle&rsquo;s account
of his interview with the Tashi L&#257;ma on November 8,
1774 (abbreviated from Markham&rsquo;s Tibet):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the afternoon I had my first audience of the Tashi L&#257;ma. He
is about forty years of age, of low stature, and inclining to be fat. His
complexion is fairer than that of most Tibetans, and his arms are as
white as those of a European; his hair, which is jet black, is cut very
short; his eyes are small and black. The expression of his countenance
is smiling and good-humoured. He was upon his throne, formed
<span class="pb" id="Page_445">445</span>
of wood carved and gilt, with some cushions above it, upon which he
sat with his legs folded under him. He was dressed in a mitre-shaped
cap of yellow broadcloth, with long bars lined with red satin, a yellow
cloth jacket without sleeves, and a satin mantle of the same colour
thrown over his shoulders. On one side of him stood his physician,
with a bundle of perfumed sandal-wood rods burning in his hand; on
the other stood his cup-bearer. I laid the Governor&rsquo;s presents before
him, delivering the letter and the pearl necklace into his own hands,
together with a white handkerchief on my own part, according to the
custom of the country. He received me in the most engaging
manner. I was seated on a high stool covered with a carpet. Plates
of boiled mutton, boiled rice, dried fruits, sweetmeats, sugar, bundles
of tea, dried sheep&rsquo;s carcases, etc., were set before me and my companion,
Mr. Hamilton. The L&#257;ma drank two or three dishes of tea
with us, but without saying any grace, asked us once or twice to eat,
and on our retiring threw white handkerchiefs over our necks. After
two or three visits, he used to receive me without any ceremony, his
head uncovered, and dressed only in the large red petticoat worn by
all full monks, red boots, a yellow cloth vest, with his arms bare, and
a piece of coarse yellow cloth thrown across his shoulders. He sat
sometimes in a chair, sometimes on a bench covered with tiger-skins,
and nobody but the cup-bearer present. Sometimes he would walk
with me about the room, explain the pictures, or make some remarks
upon the colour of my eyes, etc. For, although venerated as God&rsquo;s
vicegerent through all the eastern countries of Asia, and endowed
with a portion of omniscience and with many other divine attributes,
he throws aside in conversation all the awful part of his character,
accommodates himself to the weakness of mortals, endeavours to make
himself loved rather than feared, and behaves with the greatest
affability to everybody, particularly to strangers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1783, when Tashi Lunpo was visited by Captain
Turner, the monastery consisted of 400 houses, many of
which were built of stone and marble, and at least two
stories high. They contained about 3700 monks (now
3800). Around the houses were gilded temples, pinnacles,
pyramidal monuments (St&#363;pas), and above all the
palace of the Tashi L&#257;ma, forming a striking spectacle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_446">446</div>
<p>Captain Turner had a remarkable interview with the
Grand L&#257;ma at the neighbouring monastery of Terpaling,
on December 4, 1783. He found the princely
child, then aged eighteen months, seated on a throne,
with his father and mother standing on the left hand.
Having been informed that, although unable to speak,
he could understand, Captain Turner intimated to him
&lsquo;that the Governor-General, on receiving news of his
decease, had been overwhelmed with sorrow, and continued
to lament his absence from the world until the
cloud was dispelled by his re-appearance. The Governor
hoped that he might long continue to illumine the
world by his presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The infant looked steadfastly at the British envoy,
and appeared to be listening to his words with deep
attention, while he repeatedly nodded his head, as if he
understood every syllable. He was silent and sedate,
and conducted himself with astonishing dignity. Captain
Turner thought him one of the handsomest children he
had ever seen. It seems that he grew up to be an able
and devout ruler, gratifying the Tibetans by his presence
for many years, and living to a good old age.</p>
<p>Tashi Lunpo was not visited by the French missionaries,
but M. Huc informs us (ii. 157) that in 1846
the then Panchen L&#257;ma was 60 years of age, and still
vigorous. M. Huc was told that he was of Indian
origin, and that he had declared of himself that his first
incarnation had taken place in India some thousands of
years before.</p>
<p>Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s, from whose notes of a journey
in Tibet so many extracts have been already given,
<span class="pb" id="Page_447">447</span>
writes thus of his arrival at Tashi Lunpo on the 9th of
December, 1881 (the extract is not given literally, and
is abbreviated):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the afternoon we arrived at Tashi Lunpo. In front of the
western entrance I noticed two Chortens (that is, &lsquo;&#262;aityas or St&#363;pas,&rsquo;
see <a href="#Page_504">p. 504</a> of these Lectures), one very large, with a gilt spire, and the
other small. On entering the grand monastery, I mustered all my
knowledge of Buddhist ceremonies and monkish etiquette, that I might
not be criticised by the passing monks as one unacquainted with the
duties of the wearers of the sacred costume. I walked slowly and
with gravity, but secretly observing everything around me. There
were a few yaks under the charge of three or four herdsmen, waiting
probably for the return of some of their number from within the
monastery. Some monks, riding on mules, passed us from north to
south. A few parties with heavy grain packages on their backs were
entering the monastery along with us. The rays of the sun, now
slanting on the gilded spires of houses and tombs in the monastery,
presented a very magnificent view to the eye.</p>
<p>While residing in the monastery I saw people busily engaged in
out-door work, such as collecting fuel and tending cattle. In fact,
this was the busiest part of the year, when the Tibetans remain on the
move for the purpose of buying and selling, at a time when the
intensely cold winds wither up the vegetation, freeze the streams,
harden the soil, and dry up the skin. The monks, like the lay-people,
are remarkable for their habit of early rising. No monk within the
walls of the monastery rose later than five in the morning, and the
usual time for getting up was four a. m. Those who slept later, without
any special cause, were subject to correction. At three in the
morning the great trumpet summons all the monks to the religious
service in the congregation hall. Whoever fails to attend is punished
next morning. No register is kept, yet the officer who superintends
the discipline can tell what monk out of two thousand has absented
himself on any particular day. I was the only man who slept up to
six in the morning. The monks used often to remark that, were
I a regular monk of the monastery, the superintendent&rsquo;s birch would
have stript my body of its flesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About six miles from Tashi Lunpo, and on the road
<span class="pb" id="Page_448">448</span>
leading from it in a south-westerly direction towards the
monastery of Sakya (see below), is the monastery of
<i>Narthang</i>, whence issued one of the three copies of the
Kanjur (<a href="#Page_272">p. 272</a>) brought to Europe by Brian Hodgson.</p>
<p>We have now to notice the two most important
monasteries of the Red sect.</p>
<p>First, <i>Sam ye</i> (Sam yas) is on the great river Tsanpo,
about forty miles from Lh&#257;ssa, in a south-easterly direction.
It was the first monastery founded in the eighth
century by Padma-sambhava, after King Khri Srong
De Tsan&rsquo;s restoration of Buddhism (pp. <a href="#Page_271">271</a>, <a href="#Page_272">272</a>).
It is the metropolitan monastery of the Red-capped
monks and Urgyanpa sect. Sam ye was visited by
the Indian explorer Nain Singh in 1874, on his final
journey to Lh&#257;ssa<a class="fn" id="fr_236" href="#fn_236">[236]</a>, and by Sarat Chandra D&#257;s in 1882.
Many of its images are of gold, and it possesses an
extensive library. Padma-sambhava was a master of
Indian Yoga and magic. He is fabled to have worked
many miracles&mdash;such as filling empty jars with divine
water&mdash;at Sam ye. He undertook to expel all evil
demons from Tibet, but was opposed by the Bon priests.</p>
<p>The other chief monastery of the Red sect is that of
<i>Sakya</i> (Saskya), situated about fifty-five miles from
Tashi Lunpo, on the road leading in a south-westerly
direction towards Nep&#257;l. It has four great sanctuaries
and a celebrated library, and is surrounded by a large
town, with temples and houses mostly painted red
(<a href="#Page_273">p. 273</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_449">449</div>
<p>It should be noted that in all the large monasteries
of Northern Buddhist countries, varied assortments of
vestments, robes, costumes, and masks are kept for use
in the religious dances, masquerades, and dramatic performances
which are a characteristic of Northern Buddhism.
Indeed, some of the richer monasteries possess
extensive wardrobes of great value, and the monks in
their masquerading dances change their costumes very
frequently and with great rapidity (see pp. <a href="#Page_347">347</a>-350).</p>
<p>Note, too, that the libraries of such monasteries generally
contain large and valuable collections of books.
The 108 volumes of the northern canon called Kanjur,
with the commentaries called Tanjur (see <a href="#Page_272">p. 272</a>), constitute
a library in themselves. In addition to these,
there are vast numbers of other treatises written to
elucidate the mysteries of Northern Buddhism, most of
which are still a terra incognita to European scholars.
It is well known that in medi&aelig;val times some Buddhist
monasteries became seats of learning, which might have
vied with the most learned Universities established at
that period in Europe.</p>
<h3><i>Temples.</i></h3>
<p>Although temples have been already adverted to as
forming an important feature in all monasteries, and
often an actual part of the edifice constituting the
monastery; it will be worth while to devote a short
space of time to their separate consideration.</p>
<p>In the earliest days of Buddhism neither temples nor
halls nor rooms for meeting together (sa&#7749;gha-g&#7771;iha) were
much needed. The monk recited the Law in the open
air or in the houses of the laity. It was only when
<span class="pb" id="Page_450">450</span>
collections of monks crystallized into regularly organized
communities, and a kind of congregational recitation of
the Law became a part of every day&rsquo;s duty, that the
monks required places of assembly like churches for the
performance of religious services.</p>
<p>Such places of meeting were often, like the cells for
the monks, excavated out of rocks. And, since relic-shrines
called &#262;aityas (as well as St&#363;pas, see <a href="#Page_504">p. 504</a>)
were erected at the further extremity of the excavated
hall, the hall itself was generally called a &#262;aitya.</p>
<p>The two principal rock-excavated &#262;aitya-halls visited
by me were at Elor&#257; (also spelt Ellora and Elur&#257;) and
at K&#257;rle (K&#257;rl&#299;). I was also much interested in a smaller
one at the N&#257;sik caves. In their interior structure they
are all strikingly like ancient Christian churches.</p>
<p>The <i>Elor&#257;</i> &#262;aitya forms one of the series of caves
already mentioned (<a href="#Page_169">p. 169</a>). It is probably as old as
the sixth century of our era, and is of an elongated horse-shoe
shape, with a massive ribbed roof arched like that
of a cathedral, supported on twenty-eight octagonal
columns, over which runs a curious frieze, having on it a
carved representation of a buffalo-hunt and boar-chase.
There is a nave with side-aisles about 86 feet long by
43 broad. Moreover, over the entrance, supported by
two square columns, is a gallery which may have served
for a choir or for a band of musicians. A lofty solid
D&#257;gaba, in shape like a massive dome resting on a
cylindrical base, stands at the further end of the nave,
the aisles being continued round it, so that worshippers
may circumambulate the apse. The front of this immense
relic-receptacle is hollowed out to receive a colossal
<span class="pb" id="Page_451">451</span>
sedent figure of the Buddha, about 17 feet high<a class="fn" id="fr_237" href="#fn_237">[237]</a>, with
the Bodhi-tree carved in an arch above his head. Two
images of attendants are in an erect attitude, one on
each side, but are not so prominent as to draw off the
eye from the immense central figure.</p>
<p>The Br&#257;hmans have now appropriated this cave, and
dedicated it to Vi&#7777;va-karma, the supposed patron deity
of builders and carpenters. I was told that carpenters
come from all parts of the country to worship the image
in its Br&#257;hmanical character. As a token of honour,
they smear it with red paint.</p>
<p>I noticed a remarkable sculpture carved out of the
rock near this cave-temple. It represented worshippers
praying to Padma-p&#257;ni to be delivered from fire, from
sword, from captivity, from wild beasts, from snakes, and
from the skeleton Death who is seen approaching.</p>
<p>The &#262;aitya cave at <i>K&#257;rle</i>, near Poona, which I visited
in 1876, is in all its dimensions and arrangements
similar to the Vi&#7777;va-karma cave at Elor&#257;, but is still
larger, finer, and more imposing. It has a nave and
side aisles, terminating in an apse, round which the aisle
is carried. The whole is about 124 feet long by 45&frac12;
feet broad and 46 feet in height. There are fifteen
pillars on each side, separating the nave from the aisles,
and under the dome of the apse is the D&#257;gaba (or
&#262;aitya)&mdash;a two-storied cylindrical drum, surmounted by
a Tee ornament (<a href="#Page_456">p. 456</a>), on which is a wooden umbrella.
There is a cavity in the D&#257;gaba for relics, though none
are now to be found there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_452">452</div>
<p>This wonderful excavation at K&#257;rle is one of the
most magnificent monuments of ancient Buddhism, and
one of the most interesting examples of early Buddhistic
art to be seen anywhere in India. And, more than this,
it is probably one of the most striking places of congregational
worship to be seen anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Of course these rock-excavated churches soon developed
into temples (Vih&#257;ras) built of stone or brick,
some of which were of a monumental character, like
that at Buddha-Gay&#257;, already described (see <a href="#Page_390">p. 390</a>),
while others were unpretending structures near villages,
where the laity could repeat their prayers or make
offerings. Others, again, formed the most important
edifice among the group of buildings constituting a
monastery.</p>
<p>The village temples might more suitably be called
chapels. All have some features in common. At the
further end of a dimly-lighted room is an altar of stone
or wood. On this are placed the idols, and around them
are arranged vases and cups, in which the offerings of the
laity are deposited. The larger edifices have vestibules,
and at the entrance are generally rude images of the
four great kings (<a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>), who are supposed to be the
guardians of Buddhism (<a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>), while inside there are
sculptures, frescoes, and pictures illustrative of the
various births and transmigrations of the Buddhas and
Bodhi-sattvas. In the precincts is always to be found a
Bodhi-tree (Bo-tree, <a href="#Page_519">p. 519</a>), if the climate and soil will
admit of its being reared. The greater number of
sacred structures, however, even those of a more important
kind and more entitled to be called temples, are
<span class="pb" id="Page_453">453</span>
mere square or oblong rectangular buildings, without
architectural design or ornamentation.</p>
<p>In Ceylon I visited a temple of this kind on the shore
of the Kandy lake. It consisted of a large bare room or
small hall, at the further end of which was a curtain
concealing a highly venerated image of the Buddha.
The attendant drew aside the curtain and showed us
the image, which had representations of rays of light
issuing from all parts of his body, as well as five rays
emerging from the crown of his head. In the enclosure
or &lsquo;compound&rsquo; of the temple, was a bell-shaped D&#257;gaba
or relic-shrine of solid brick-work, covered with Chunam,
and having a receptacle for lights in front of it. Close
at hand was the usual sacred P&#299;pal-tree.</p>
<p>At <i>Kelani</i>, about eight miles from Colombo, is a larger
and much more important temple which I also visited.
Those who make pilgrimages to this temple gain great
stores of merit. It contains a colossal recumbent image
of the Buddha, thirty-six feet long, lying on his right
side, and representing the founder of Buddhism when
about to pass into Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a (see <a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>). The image
is protected by a screen, in the centre of which is a
figure of the King of Serpents, while at the sides are
gigantic images of the temple-guardians. Around the
interior are fresco paintings of various incidents in the
previous lives of the Buddha. There are also images of
the Hind&#363; gods Vish&#7751;u, &#7776;iva, and Ga&#7751;e&#7777;a (see <a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>).
In the garden of the temple are residences for the monks,
a cloister-like enclosure, a room with a good printing
press, and an immense P&#299;pal-tree.</p>
<p>A still more important temple is that called the
<span class="pb" id="Page_454">454</span>
Dalada M&#257;lig&#257;wa or temple of the sacred eye-tooth, at
Kandy in Ceylon. This is a very picturesque structure,
situated on the margin of the lake close to the town.
It has no surrounding walls, and is easily accessible to
all comers. Steps lead up to a kind of open corridor,
in which is the main entrance, and the walls of which
are decorated with coloured frescoes of the eight principal
hells&mdash;the supposed abode of evil-doers undergoing
purgatorial torments during one of their states of existence
(see <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>)<a class="fn" id="fr_238" href="#fn_238">[238]</a>.</p>
<p>Some are represented in the act of being cut in pieces
by demons, or fixed on red-hot iron spikes, or torn
asunder with glowing tongs, or sawn in two with saws,
or crushed between rocks, or consumed by flames entering
the apertures of their bodies. The European visitor
inquires with amazement how it is that a system so
mild, merciful, and tolerant, should have invented the
horrible tortures here exhibited. The explanation is
not difficult, and his astonishment ceases when he is
reminded that Buddhism, recognizing no moral Governor
of the Universe, is compelled to resort to such artifices
for the coercion and intimidation of evil-doers.</p>
<p>In the interior of the building is the shrine, in which
is preserved behind iron bars, the golden D&#257;gaba or
receptacle of one of the Buddha&rsquo;s eye-teeth (see <a href="#Page_500">p. 500</a>).
On each side are images, and when I visited the shrine,
the whole chamber was redolent with the fragrance of
masses of flowers&mdash;chiefly jasmine&mdash;recently deposited
before them as offerings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_455">455</div>
<p>Behind the building I found an open quadrangle with
cells for the monks, and a residence for the Head of the
monastery. Not far from the entrance was a spacious
library, where I was greeted by a number of youthful
monks, dressed in simple toga-like vestments, but with
their right shoulders left bare. Some were engaged in
writing. I therefore asked for a specimen of their penmanship.
Upon which they wrote down for me on palm
leaves, in the Sinhalese character, forty-eight epithets
of the Buddha, such as the following:&mdash;God of the gods,
Indra of Indras, Brahm&#257; of Brahm&#257;s, the Almighty,
Omniscient, Existing in his own Law, Lord of the Law,
Saviour of all, Conqueror, King of doctrine, Ocean of
grace, Treasury, Jewel, Sun, Moon, Stars, Lotus, Ambrosia
of the World, the Five-eyed one, the Bull,
Elephant, Lion among men, stronger than the strongest,
mightier than the mightiest, more merciful than the
most merciful, more meritorious than the most meritorious,
more beautiful than the most beautiful, etc.</p>
<p>The temples in Burma are commonly called &lsquo;pagodas,&rsquo;
a word corrupted from the P&#257;li D&#257;gaba (Sansk&#7771;it
Dh&#257;tu-garbha), &lsquo;receptacle of the (sacred) elements&rsquo; or
relics of the body. They are also called Dagohn. According
to Mr. Scott (&lsquo;Burman,&rsquo; i. 184), the number of
temples in Burma far exceeds those in Ceylon or Tibet
or China. No village so poor as to be without its
&lsquo;neatly kept shrine, with the remains of others
mouldering away around it; no hill so steep as to be
without its glittering gold or snow-white spire rising
up to guard the place; no work of merit so richly paid
as the building of a pagoda.&rsquo; Some are of simple construction,
<span class="pb" id="Page_456">456</span>
others elaborate; but of all the temples the
great Rangoon pagoda is the grandest and most crowded
with worshippers and pilgrims.</p>
<p>The peculiar sacredness and popularity of this wonderful
structure (said to have been founded 588 <span class="small">B.C.</span>),
arises from its containing relics of Gautama and his
three predecessors, that is, eight hairs from Gautama&rsquo;s
head, the staff of K&#257;&#7777;yapa, the robe of Kanaka-muni,
and the drinking-cup of Kraku-&#263;&#263;handa (see <a href="#Page_135">p. 135</a> of
these Lectures). The stately pile stands upon a mound&mdash;partly
natural, partly artificial&mdash;cut into two rectangular
terraces one above the other, the upper being
166 feet above the ground, and each side facing one of
the cardinal points of the compass. The ascent is by very
dilapidated steps, some of stone, some of &lsquo;sun-dried bricks,
worn almost into a slope by the bare feet of myriads of
worshippers.&rsquo; None but Europeans may ascend with
covered feet. The stairs lead to a &lsquo;broad, open flagged
space, which runs all round the pagoda, and is left free
for worshippers.&rsquo; From the centre of this springs, from
an octagonal plinth, the &lsquo;profusely gilt <i>solid brick</i>
pagoda,&rsquo; which has a circumference of 1355 feet, and
rises to a height of about 328, &lsquo;or nearly as high as
St. Paul&rsquo;s cathedral.&rsquo; On the summit is &lsquo;the Tee,&rsquo;
a gilt umbrella-shaped ornament with many tiers of
rings, on each of which &lsquo;hang multitudes of gold and
silver jewelled bells.&rsquo; It was &lsquo;placed there at a cost
of not much less than &pound;50,000<a class="fn" id="fr_239" href="#fn_239">[239]</a>.&rsquo; At the foot of the
pagoda are four chapels, having colossal figures of Buddha
<span class="pb" id="Page_457">457</span>
at the sides, and their gilded interiors darkened by
the vapour of thousands of burning tapers. &lsquo;Hundreds
of Gautamas,&rsquo; large and small, white and black, gilded
and plain, sitting, standing, and reclining, surround
the larger images. It is said that the great pagoda
has been thrice covered with gold-leaf.</p>
<p>There is a still higher pagoda (332 feet high) at
Pegu, and the most ancient of all is at Arakan.</p>
<p>Passing to Northern Buddhist countries, we find that
the temples are generally simple, and not to be compared
with the grand pagodas of Burma.</p>
<p>For example, at Tassiding in Sikkim, Sir Richard
Temple (Journal, ii. 204) found that the two principal
temples were chapel-like structures with &lsquo;overshadowing
umbrella-shaped roofs, thatched with split bamboos.&rsquo;
The walls were of rough stone, the upper half being
painted red. The interiors, which were dimly lighted,
had two stories, the walls being covered with coloured
frescoes illustrating the punishments in the various
hells, &lsquo;some of which would be suitable for illustrations
of Dante&rsquo;s Inferno.&rsquo; The ends opposite to the entrance
were filled with images. In other parts of the chapels
were praying-machines, and on shelves the remnants of
a library of sacred Buddhist manuscripts. Sir Richard
attended a religious service in one of these chapels,
which consisted of a series of chants and invocations
to a female demon called Tanma, represented by a
hideous lay figure dressed in robes. According to
tradition, it was the malevolent action of the twelve
Tanmas in bringing pestilences on the Tibetans, that
led them to send for Padma-sambhava, who introduced
<span class="pb" id="Page_458">458</span>
the debased Buddhism subsequently prevalent in Tibet
(Note by Capt. R. C. Temple).</p>
<p>According to Dr. Schlagintweit (p. 189) and Koeppen
the generality of temples in Mongolia and Tibet consist
of one large square or rectangular room, with an
entrance-hall or vestibule, which in Mongolia looks to
the south and in Tibet to the east. &lsquo;The inside
surface is whitewashed or covered with a kind of
plaster,&rsquo; and decorated with paintings representing
episodes taken from the life of the Buddhas, or with
pictures of gods and goddesses of terrible aspect.
Generally images of the four great kings are placed
here as guardians of the sanctuary (<a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a> of this
volume). Sometimes there are side chambers, which
may be compared to transepts, and give the building
the form of a cross. These chambers often have
shelves for the sacred books, wrapped in silk. In the
corners are tables for images of the deities, religious
dresses, musical instruments, etc. Other articles required
for the daily service are hung up on wooden
pegs along the walls. Benches for the L&#257;mas are
placed in the hall of the temple.</p>
<p>The altar at the further extremity rises in steps
made of wood, beautifully carved and richly ornamented.
Upon these are arranged images of the Buddhas and
Bodhi-sattvas, and especially the chief idol representing
Gautama Buddha in some of his forms and attitudes.
Here also are vessels for offerings, bells, Dorjes (<a href="#Page_323">p. 323</a>),
and other utensils used in religious worship. Among
the latter may be seen the mirror (Melong, see p. 463)
used in the ceremony described at <a href="#Page_335">p. 335</a>. There is
<span class="pb" id="Page_459">459</span>
also a vase with peacock&rsquo;s feathers, and a sacred book
is never wanting.</p>
<p>The vessels for offerings are of brass, and like tea-cups.
They are usually filled with barley, butter, and
perfumes, and in summer with flowers. Near at hand
is a Chorten (p. 380) containing relics, and having a
niche with the image of a Buddha or Bodhi-sattva,
to whom the temple may perhaps be dedicated.</p>
<p>Finally, in the entrance-vestibule, at both sides of
the door, as well as in the interior, stand rows of large
and small prayer-cylinders, which are perpetually kept
revolving by the attendant L&#257;mas.</p>
<p>Of course the temples at the great centres of Tibetan
Buddhism in and near Lh&#257;ssa, Tashi Lunpo, and other
important places, are far more imposing. Indeed, for
magnificence, few religious edifices in any part of the
world can compare with them.</p>
<p>The great temple (called <i>Cho Khang</i>) in the monastery
of <i>L&#257; brang</i> at Lh&#257;ssa is a kind of centre of the
L&#257;mistic Church. It is the first and oldest temple, and,
as before stated (<a href="#Page_440">p. 440</a>), the St. Peter&rsquo;s of L&#257;mism<a class="fn" id="fr_240" href="#fn_240">[240]</a>.</p>
<p>The facade of this vast structure looks to the east,
and in front of it is a square place, with a kind of
obelisk or monolith, commemorating the victory of the
Tibetans over the Chinese in the ninth century, as well
as more recent treaties of peace and friendship between
the two countries. The main building is three stories
high. Before the entrance stands a lofty flag-pole, forty
<span class="pb" id="Page_460">460</span>
feet high<a class="fn" id="fr_241" href="#fn_241">[241]</a>, and not far off is a poplar, said to have
sprung &lsquo;from the consecrated hair of Buddha.&rsquo; The
portico of the temple consists of a colonnade of six
thick wooden columns. The walls of the portico are
covered with rude paintings, representing scenes in the
biography of Gautama Buddha. In the middle are
folding doors adorned with bronze carvings in relief.
Through these is the entrance into the front hall, over
which is the first story. In the wall opposite to the
entrance is a second door, on each side of which stand
two colossal statues of the four great kings (see pp. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>, <a href="#Page_51">51</a>, <a href="#Page_53">53</a>, <a href="#Page_54">54</a>
of this volume).</p>
<p>This second door leads into the interior of the building.
On entering, the visitor finds himself in a vast
temple, shaped like a basilica, divided by rows of
columns into three naves and two transepts. The
broad central nave is lighted from above by transparent
oil-cloth instead of glass. This is the only light
which finds its way into the temple, as there are no
side windows. On the outside of the two secondary
naves is a row of small chapels, fourteen on one side
and fourteen on the other. The two transepts form
the back-ground of the great hall, and are separated
from the naves by a silver lattice-work. Here, at the
ordinary services, are the seats of the inferior monks.
From the west transept a staircase leads to another
pillared transept, which forms the vestibule of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_461">461</span>
sanctuary. In the middle of the sanctuary, which is
square in form, is the altar for offerings. Beyond the
altar, at the west side of the sanctuary, and therefore
in the furthest recess of the whole building, is a quadrangular
niche. In front of this niche on the left
is the throne of the Dalai L&#257;ma, very lofty, richly
adorned and furnished with five cushions, as is customary
in the case of Grand L&#257;mas. On one side of the
Dalai L&#257;ma&rsquo;s throne is a similar throne for the Panchen
L&#257;ma, and then, in regular order, the thrones of the
Khutuktus and other Avat&#257;ra L&#257;mas. The Khanpos
and the whole non-Avat&#257;ra monkhood have seats in the
transept.</p>
<p>Opposite to the throne of the Dalai L&#257;ma, on the
right of the niche, is the chair of the Regent, which is
less elevated than the thrones of the Avat&#257;ra L&#257;mas.
Behind are the seats of the four ministers, which again
are less elevated than those of the non-Avat&#257;ra L&#257;mas.
At the west end of the niche is the high altar, which
rises in numerous steps. On the upper steps are small
images of deified saints, in massive gold or silver. On
the lower ones, as on all Buddhist altars, are lamps,
incense-holders, bowls for offerings, etc. On the highest
elevation, behind silver and golden lattice-work, is the
celebrated image of Gautama Buddha richly gilded.
This image is said to have been constructed in Magadha
during the lifetime of the Buddha. Others hold it
to be self-produced; and another tradition ascribes its
origin to the god Vi&#7777;va-karma, who, instructed by
Indra, constructed it with equal parts of five metals and
five precious stones. Besides this highest object of
<span class="pb" id="Page_462">462</span>
worship, the temple contains countless images and
pictures of Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas (such as D&#299;pa&#7747;kara,
Amit&#257;bha, Maitreya, the eleven-faced Avalokite&#7777;vara,
Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;, etc.), besides gods and goddesses<a class="fn" id="fr_242" href="#fn_242">[242]</a>,
and historical personages, such as Tsong Khapa, who
have benefited the L&#257;mistic church (among them being
a statue of Hiouen Thsang), as well as relics, and gold
and silver vessels, which are exhibited every year at the
beginning of the third month.</p>
<p>Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s, who, in his &lsquo;Narrative,&rsquo; records
his visit to the great Lh&#257;ssa temple, informs us
that when he was there, five thousand oil-burners were
lighted in the court of the temple, and those before the
principal image were all of gold. He found some of the
subordinate chapels infested by mice, which are never
touched, because supposed to be metamorphosed monks.
He observed some Buddhists from Nep&#257;l chanting
Sansk&#7771;it hymns, and others engaged in circumambulation,
while the muttering of Om Ma&#7751;i padme H&#363;m
(<a href="#Page_372">p. 372</a>) was incessant.</p>
<p>Mr. Sarat Chandra D&#257;s also describes a visit he paid
to the famous shrine of <i>Ramo&#263;he</i>, before adverted to
(see <a href="#Page_441">p. 441</a>). I give his description in an abbreviated
form:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our equipment was as usual a bundle of incense-sticks, clarified
butter, and a few scarves. Our road turned westward by the side of
a long Mandong (see <a href="#Page_380">p. 380</a>). I left it to my right-hand side, seeing that
to have kept it on my left would have been heretical. A few hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_463">463</span>
paces brought us to the gate of the famous temple of Ramo&#263;he,
erected by the wife of King Srong Tsan Gampo, the first Chinese
princess who introduced Buddhism into Tibet. It is a lofty edifice,
flat-roofed, and three stories high, surrounded by a stone wall, with
a high and wide porch. About thirty monks were solemnly seated to
perform a religious service, on two sides of a row of pillars which
supported the roof. The image brought by the Nep&#257;lese princess, lay
midway between the pillars. It was grand-looking; and, though its
face was gilded, its antiquity was manifest. In the northern lobby
of the temple was a vast collection of ancient relics, such as shields,
spears, drums, arrows, sabres, long knives, trumpets, etc. In a room
to the left of the entrance, enclosed by iron lattice-work, were a few
images considered especially sacred. We were also shown a brass
mirror, called Melong, said to be possessed of wonderful properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of the shrine, according to the same
traveller, is this:&mdash;The princess being thoroughly versed
in astrology, found that there was a spot close to the
new-built city of Lh&#257;ssa which was connected with the
lower regions of torment. On that plot of ground she
erected the shrine of Ramo&#263;he, on the chief altar of
which she placed the famous statue of Buddha, brought
from China. In this way she hoped to intercept the
passage (<i>gati</i>) of wicked people to a life in one of the
hells (see <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>). Whoever, at the time of death, was
brought to this sanctuary, could only be born again in
the worlds of either men or gods.</p>
<p>Finally we come to the temple at the second great
Metropolis of Buddhism:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Bogle (Markham&rsquo;s Tibet, p. 100) describes the
temple in the monastery at Tashi Lunpo as simply a
long room or gallery containing thirteen gigantic figures
made of copper gilt, all in a sedent attitude, with their
legs folded under them. He found them all draped,
<span class="pb" id="Page_464">464</span>
with jewelled crowns and necklaces of coral, pearls, and
other stones. The thrones on which they sat were also
of copper gilt, and adorned with turquoises and
cornelians. Behind them were a variety of conch-shells,
set in silver, ostrich-eggs, cocoa-nuts, and other articles.
At each end of the gallery was a large collection of
books deposited in pigeon-holes. Mr. Bogle was present
when the Tashi L&#257;ma himself entered the temple, and,
as he passed along, sprinkled rice upon the images.
This was a kind of consecration-ceremony.</p>
<p>As an instance of the tolerant character of Buddhism
and its readiness to accommodate itself to the indigenous
creeds of the countries into which it was introduced,
we may note, in conclusion, that in Japan may be seen
Buddhist and Shinto temples side by side or even
occasionally combined in one building. Buddhism in
fact adopted Shintoism in Japan just as it adopted
Shamanism in Tibet. It took the deities and demi-gods
of Shintoism and turned them into Bodhi-sattvas<a class="fn" id="fr_243" href="#fn_243">[243]</a>.</p>
<p>The subject of Monasteries and Temples naturally
leads us to that of images and image-worship; but this
and the whole subject of &lsquo;Sacred Objects&rsquo; must be reserved
for the next two Lectures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_465">465</div>
<h2 id="c21">LECTURE XVI.
<br /><i>Images and Idols.</i></h2>
<p>On several occasions during my travels through all
parts of India, I asked intelligent Pa&#7751;&#7693;its how they
could reconcile the gross idolatry and fetish-worship
which meet the eye at almost every step throughout
the length and breadth of their land, with the doctrine
repeatedly declared to be the only true creed of
Br&#257;hmanism&mdash;the doctrine that nothing really exists
but the one eternal, omnipresent Spirit of the Universe
(named Brahman or Brahm&#259;)<a class="fn" id="fr_244" href="#fn_244">[244]</a>.</p>
<p>The answer I generally received to this inquiry was,
that spiritual worship was at first the only form of
religion dominant in India, till the Buddhists set the
example of worshipping material objects and images
(pratim&#257;-p&#363;j&#257;).</p>
<p>Of course it is impossible to say what amount of
truth there may be in this accusation. It seems
probable that material impersonations of the forces
of nature existed before the Buddha&rsquo;s time. Yet there
is no evidence of the prevalence of actual idolatry at
the time when the &#7770;ig-veda was composed. Nor is
there any very clear allusion to it in Manu. Nor
have any images of Hind&#363; gods been found which are
<span class="pb" id="Page_466">466</span>
so ancient as some Buddhist images. At the same
time nothing is said about image-worship in the
Buddhist Pi&#7789;akas. The statement that the Buddha
himself sanctioned idolatry is wholly legendary (see
<a href="#Page_177">p. 177</a>). Nor is there any proof that carved images of
his person were common in India till several centuries
after his death.</p>
<p>The Bharhut sculptures of about the second century
<span class="small">B.C.</span>&mdash;though representing many scenes connected with
the Buddha (see pp. <a href="#Page_408">408</a>, <a href="#Page_523">523</a>)&mdash;exhibit no representations
of the Buddha himself. Nor are there any on the
S&#257;nch&#299; gateway of still later date.</p>
<p>The only objects of reverence in the Bharhut sculptures,
according to Sir A. Cunningham, are Bodhi-trees,
Wheels, the Tri-ratna symbol, St&#363;pas, and foot-prints
(see pp. <a href="#Page_521">521</a>-522 of these Lectures). The bas-reliefs on
the railing at the Buddha-Gay&#257; Temple, which is of a
little earlier date, agree in making the Tree, Wheel,
Tri-ratna, and St&#363;pa the great objects of reverence.
On the other hand, in the edicts of king A&#7777;oka veneration
for the Bodhi-tree alone is enjoined. Among the
historical scenes represented in the Bharhut sculptures,
are the processions of the kings Aj&#257;ta-&#7777;atru and Prasenajit
on their visits to the Buddha; &lsquo;the former on his
elephant, the latter in his chariot, exactly as they are
described in the Buddhist chronicles.&rsquo; There are also bas-reliefs
which seem to represent R&#257;ma, during his exile,
besides images of other gods, Yakshas and N&#257;gas, but
no figure of Buddha himself is to be seen anywhere.</p>
<p>Yet it is undeniable that in the early centuries of our
era, images of Gautama Buddha and other Buddhas and
Bodhi-sattvas had become common among the Buddhists
in every part of India.</p>

</div>
<p class="center">Found in the ruins close to the south side of the Buddha-Gay&#257; temple, the date (S. 64 = <span class="small">A.D.</span> 142) being inscribed on the pedestal. (see <a href="#Page_481">p. 481</a>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_467">467</div>
<p>One of the oldest statues of the Buddha that has yet
been brought to light is the colossal image (now in
the Calcutta Museum) dug up in the ruins outside
the ancient temple at Buddha-Gay&#257; (<a href="#Page_390">p. 390</a>), the date
inscribed on which corresponds to about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 142. The
engraving (opposite) is from a photograph of this statue,
belonging to Sir A. Cunningham<a class="fn" id="fr_245" href="#fn_245">[245]</a>. The thick lips are
certainly remarkable. The attitude was probably the
&lsquo;argumentative&rsquo; or &lsquo;teaching&rsquo; (described at <a href="#Page_481">p. 481</a>).
Another colossal statue of about the same date was
found by Sir A. Cunningham at &#7776;r&#257;vast&#299; (see <a href="#Page_408">p. 408</a>).</p>
<p>It was indeed by a strange irony of fate that the man
who denied any god or any being higher than himself,
and told his followers to look to themselves alone for
salvation, should have been not only deified and worshipped,
but represented by more images than any other
being ever idolized in any part of the world. In fact
images, statues, statuettes, carvings in bas-relief, paintings,
and representations of him in all attitudes are
absolutely innumerable. In caves, monasteries, and
temples, on D&#257;gabas, votive St&#363;pas, monuments and
rocks, they are multiplied infinitely and in endless
variety, and not only are isolated images manufactured
out of all kinds of materials, but rows on rows are
sculptured in relief, and the greater the number the
<span class="pb" id="Page_468">468</span>
greater religious merit accrues to the sculptor, and&mdash;if
they are dedicated at sacred places&mdash;to the dedicator
also.</p>
<p>And not only images of the Buddha, but representations
of every object that could possibly be connected
with him, became multiplied to an indefinite extent.</p>
<p>The gradual growth of what may be called objective
Buddhism, and the steps which led to every kind of
extravagance in the idolatrous use of images, may be
described in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>It was only natural that the disciples of an ideally
perfect man, who had taught them that in passing away
at death he would become absolutely extinct, should
have devised some method of perpetuating his memory
and stimulating a desire to conform to his example.
Their first method was to preserve the relics of his
burnt body, and to honour every object associated with
his earthly career. Then, in process of time, they
began to worship not only his relics but the receptacles
under which they were buried, and around these they
placed sculptures commemorative of his life and
teaching. Thence they passed on to the carving
or moulding of small statuettes of his person in wood,
stone, metal, terra-cotta, or clay, and on these they
often inscribed the well-known Buddhistic formul&aelig;
mentioned before (see <a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>). Eventually, too, painting
was pressed into the service, and frescoes on walls
became common. Indeed in some temples paintings
take the place of images, as objects of adoration.</p>
<p>It seems likely that the use of images and paintings
was at first confined to the brotherhood, and it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_469">469</span>
alleged that they were only honoured and not worshipped.
But the more the circle of uncultured and
unthinking Buddhists became enlarged, the more did
visible representations of the founder of Buddhism
become needed, and the more they became multiplied.</p>
<p>Nor was this all. The reaction from the original
simplicity of Buddhism led to a complete repudiation
of its anti-theistic doctrines. It adopted polytheistic
superstitions even more rapidly and thoroughly than
Br&#257;hmanism did. People were not satisfied with
representations of the founder of Buddhism. They
craved for other visible and tangible objects of adoration&mdash;for
the images of other Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas&mdash;of
gods many and lords many&mdash;insomuch that
a Buddhist Pantheon was gradually created which became
peopled with a more motley crowd of occupants
than that of Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was only natural that the manufacture
of the whole array of divinities and semi-divinities,
of saints and sages, should have been committed to the
monks. They alone possessed this privilege. They
alone, too, had the power of consecrating each image
by the repetition of mystical texts and formularies.
And when images and idols were thus consecrated,
they were believed to be animated with the spirit, and
to possess all the attributes of the beings they represented.</p>
<p>In fact, the development of every phase of idolatrous
superstition reached a point of extravagance unparalleled
in any other religious system of the world. The
monks of Buddhism vied with each other in the &lsquo;pious
<span class="pb" id="Page_470">470</span>
fraud&rsquo; with which they constructed their idols. They
so manipulated them that they appeared to give out
light or to flash supernatural glances from their crystal
eyes. Or they made them deliver oracular utterances,
or they furnished them with movable limbs, so that a
head would unexpectedly nod, or a hand be raised to
bless the worshipper. Then they clothed them with
costly vestments, and adorned them with ornaments
and jewels, and treated them in every way as if they
were living energizing personalities.</p>
<p>It ought, however, to be noted here, that in some
temples images of the Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas were
said to exist which were not manufactured or consecrated
by monks. They were believed to have been self-produced,
or to have been created supernaturally out of
nothing, or to have emerged in a miraculous manner
out of vacuity. The child-like faith of uncultured and
imaginative races in the virtue supposed to be inherent
in such images was perhaps not surprising. The power of
working all kinds of miracles was gradually ascribed to
them; sicknesses were said to be healed by them, rain
to be produced, and the course of nature itself to be
subject to their direction and control.</p>
<p>The two Chinese pilgrims F&#257;-hien and Hiouen
Thsang are never tired of describing the wonders supposed
to have been wrought by the statues and idols
they saw during their travels, especially by the marvellous
sandal-wood statue mentioned before (see <a href="#Page_408">p. 408</a>).</p>
<p>The following tradition in regard to this image,
narrated by F&#257;-hien (Legge, 56, 57), is especially interesting
as showing that the general belief among all
<span class="pb" id="Page_471">471</span>
classes of Buddhists in his time was, that Gautama
Buddha himself was the first to sanction the making
of visible representations of himself:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Buddha went up to the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a heaven and preached
the law for the benefit of his mother for ninety days, Prasenajit longing
to see him, caused an image to be carved in Go&#7777;&#299;rsha sandal-wood,
and put in the place where he usually sat. When Buddha, on
his return, entered the Vih&#257;ra, this image immediately left its place,
and came forth to meet him. Buddha then said to it: &lsquo;Return to
your seat. After I have attained Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a you shall serve as a
pattern to the four classes (paths, see <a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>) of my disciples.&rsquo; Thereupon
the image returned to its seat. This was the very first of all
the images of Buddha, and that which men subsequently copied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Hiouen Thsang&rsquo;s narrative, which is of much later
date (see <a href="#Page_413">p. 413</a>), we find the following account of this
celebrated sandal-wood image (Beal, ii. 322):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the town of Pim&#257; (Pi-mo) there is a figure of Buddha in a
standing position made of sandal-wood. The figure is about twenty
feet high. It works many miracles, and reflects constantly a bright
light. Those who have any disease, according to the part affected,
cover the corresponding place on the statue with gold-leaf, and forthwith
they are healed. People who address prayers to it, with a
sincere heart, mostly obtain their wishes. This is what the natives
say: &lsquo;This image in old days, when Buddha was alive, was made by
Udayana, King of Kau&#7777;&#257;mb&#299; (see <a href="#Page_412">p. 412</a> of these Lectures). When
Buddha left the world, it mounted of its own accord into the air, and
came to the north of this kingdom to the town of Ho-lo-lo-kia (Urgha?).&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With regard to the form and character of the countless
images now scattered everywhere, they vary according
to country and period (see <a href="#Page_485">p. 485</a>). It should
be observed, however, that Buddhism, when it began
to encourage idolatry, did not make it hideous by
giving monstrous shapes to its idols. In this respect
early Buddhism contrasted very favourably with Hind&#363;ism.
<span class="pb" id="Page_472">472</span>
Nor did the Buddhists of India, as of other
countries, adopt the practice of endowing their idols
with extra heads and arms to symbolize power, or of
inventing grotesque combinations of the human figure
with the shapes of elephants, birds, serpents, and other
animals. They seemed rather to have tried in the first
instance to neutralize the tendency to extravagant
symbolism common among all Eastern peoples, by
delineating their great teacher as an ideal man, simply
and naturally formed, according to the Buddhist ideal
of perfection with symmetrical limbs, and a dignified,
calm, passionless, and majestic bearing. What can be
a greater contrast than the four-armed elephant-headed
village-god of India,&mdash;Ga&#7751;e&#7777;a, son of &#7776;iva<a class="fn" id="fr_246" href="#fn_246">[246]</a>&mdash;and the
purely human figure of the Buddha as shown in his
statues!</p>
<p>Nevertheless it must be admitted that in process of
time the representations of Gautama Buddha developed
certain peculiar varieties of form as well as differences
in attitude. These differences, indeed, constitute a
highly interesting topic of inquiry, and perhaps deserve
more attention than they have hitherto received
in any treatise with which I am acquainted.</p>
<p>Without going minutely into every point, we may
begin by noting a few general characteristics common
to all the Buddha&rsquo;s images.</p>
<p>In the first place, they all represent Gautama as
clothed&mdash;not naked. In this respect they present a
pleasant contrast to the images of Jaina saints; for, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_473">473</span>
already pointed out, Gautama discountenanced all extremes
of bodily mortification, and disapproved the
practice of going about nude, according to the custom
of Hind&#363; devotees. In the Dharma-pada it is said,
&lsquo;Not nakedness, not matted hair, not dirt, not fasting,
nor lying on the ground, nor smearing with ashes, nor
sitting motionless can purify a mortal who has not
overcome desires.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gautama&rsquo;s robe was drawn gracefully over his
shoulders like a toga, but probably the right shoulder
was always left bare on formal occasions. The Pi&#7789;akas
give no clear information as to this point. In Indian
statues the robe is sometimes represented as fitting so
closely to the body that the figure seems garmentless<a class="fn" id="fr_247" href="#fn_247">[247]</a>;
its presence being merely denoted by a line
running diagonally over the left shoulder across the
breast, and under the right arm. This line frequently
looks so like a cord that some have mistaken it for the
thread to which, as a Kshatriya, Buddha was entitled<a class="fn" id="fr_248" href="#fn_248">[248]</a>.
In some ancient images no trace of the line is left,
but they are not really nude. Most Indian images
have the right shoulder bare (even in the case of nuns).
Of course in colder climates both shoulders are covered.
Even in Southern countries some have both shoulders
covered, or the right partially so.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to the clothed images of the
Buddha, all the representations of his great opponent
<span class="pb" id="Page_474">474</span>
and rival Deva-datta (see pp. <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, <a href="#Page_405">405</a>) make the latter
unclothed, like a Jaina ascetic, or only partially clothed
up to the waist. Deva-datta is also represented as
shorter in stature than the Buddha.</p>
<p>Other characteristics generally to be observed in the
earlier images of Gautama Buddha are:&mdash;the impassive
tranquil features, typical of complete conquest over the
passions, and of perfect repose; the absence of all decoration
and ornament; the long pendulous ears, which
occasionally reach to the shoulders<a class="fn" id="fr_249" href="#fn_249">[249]</a>; the circle or small
globe or lotus<a class="fn" id="fr_250" href="#fn_250">[250]</a>, or auspicious mark of some kind, on the
palm or palms of the supinated hands (as well as often
on the soles of the feet), and the short knobby hair, often
carved so as to resemble a close-fitting curly wig.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that Gautama signalized
his renunciation of the world by cutting off his hair
with a sword, and the resulting stumps are said to
have turned into permanent knobs or short curls<a class="fn" id="fr_251" href="#fn_251">[251]</a>.</p>
<p>In images brought from Burma and Siam a curious
horn-like protuberance on the crown of the head&mdash;either
tapering to a point, or rounded off at the extremity&mdash;is
<span class="pb" id="Page_475">475</span>
noticeable. Often, too, sculptures found in
India show the rounded form of this excrescence.</p>
<p>Some think that it represents an ascetic&rsquo;s mass of
hair coiled up in a top-knot on the crown of the head,
as in images of the god &#7776;iva. Others regard it as
the rough outline of what ought to be an Ush&#7751;&#299;sha or
peculiar crown-like head-dress, such as may be seen in
many later images of the Buddha. Some legends
declare that the Buddha was born with this Ush&#7751;&#299;sha,
which was indicative of his future supremacy.</p>
<p>Others, again, maintain that this protuberance (sometimes
lengthened out so as to be as high as the head
itself) was a peculiar growth of the skull, and one of
the marks of a supreme Buddha indicative of supernatural
intelligence; just as in other images (especially
those brought from Ceylon) five flames&mdash;in shape like
the fingers of a hand&mdash;are represented issuing from the
crown of the head (see <a href="#Page_453">p. 453</a>), to typify the Buddha&rsquo;s
diffusion of light and knowledge throughout the world.</p>
<p>It is said that this outgrowth of the Buddha&rsquo;s skull
has been preserved as a sacred relic in a town of
Afgh&#257;nist&#257;n near Jal&#257;l&#257;b&#257;d.</p>
<p>In many representations of the Buddha, a Nimbus
or aureola of glory encircles the head (see <a href="#Page_478">p. 478</a>),
and in some images rays of light are represented as
emerging from his whole body. An image with a halo
of this kind surrounding the entire figure was seen by
me in a temple near Kandy in Ceylon (see <a href="#Page_453">p. 453</a>).</p>
<p>In Nep&#257;l many images represent Buddha holding his
alms-bowl, but these are not common in other places.</p>
<p>With regard to the size of the images, they vary
<span class="pb" id="Page_476">476</span>
from diminutive examples, two or three inches long, to
colossal statues twelve, eighteen, twenty, thirty, forty,
or even seventy feet high. They are generally carved
in stone or marble, but sometimes in metal, sometimes
in wood, and occasionally moulded in clay.</p>
<p>Much difference of opinion prevails as to the Buddha&rsquo;s
actual stature. When I asked the opinion of Buddhist
teachers in Ceylon, they all agreed in assigning to the
founder of their religion a majestic bodily frame, not
only gifting him with the possession of the thirty-two
distinguishing marks of a perfect man and supreme
Buddha (see <a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>), but with great height and imposing
presence. A common idea is that the eighteen-feet
statues represent life-size. According to other
legends the Buddha&rsquo;s stature reached to twenty cubits.
In China, the mythical history of Buddha gives
him a height of only sixteen feet<a class="fn" id="fr_252" href="#fn_252">[252]</a>. His arms are by
some said to have been so long, that he was able to
touch his knees with his hands without stooping, and
if we are to take the supposed impress of his foot on
Adam&rsquo;s Peak and in Siam as the measure of his stature,
he must have been the most gigantic giant that ever
lived. Even one of the most enlightened natives of
Ceylon, the late Mr. James d&rsquo;Alwis&mdash;a convert to
Christianity&mdash;told me, in explanation of the abnormal
size of the eye-tooth at Kandy, that he was convinced
that all human beings were taller in Buddha&rsquo;s time,
and that Gautama was taller than his fellow-men of
those days, and was about eight feet high. It was his
opinion that as sin increases in the world, so men&rsquo;s
stature decreases. Probably the Buddha was tall, even
for the North-west of India, where the average of a man&rsquo;s
stature is about five feet eight or nine inches.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">SCULPTURE FOUND BY SIR A. CUNNINGHAM AT S&#256;RN&#256;TH, NEAR BENARES,</span></p>
</div>
<p class="center">Illustrating the four principal events in Gautama Buddha&rsquo;s life&mdash;his birth from his mother&rsquo;s side, his attainment of Buddhahood under the tree, his teaching at Benares, and his passing away in complete Nirv&#257;&#7751;a. (Date of the sculpture, about 400 <span class="small">A.D.</span>)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_477">477</div>
<p>As to the attitudes of Gautama&rsquo;s images, they
may be classed under the three heads of sedent, erect,
and recumbent. I use the word &lsquo;sedent&rsquo; for what
ought to be called a squatting position, with the legs
folded under the body. Images which represent a
figure sitting in European fashion are rare.</p>
<p>Four principal images represent the four principal
events in Buddha&rsquo;s life, as shown in the S&#257;rn&#257;th sculpture
engraved on the opposite page (compare <a href="#Page_387">p. 387</a>).</p>
<p>The first sedent attitude may be called the &lsquo;Meditative.&rsquo;
The example below is described at <a href="#Page_xxx">p. xxx</a>. 15.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/i477.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="547" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_478">478</div>
<p>This represents the Buddha seated, in meditation,
on a raised seat under the sacred tree, with the two
hands supinated, one over the other.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/i478.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="793" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>The second sedent attitude may be called the
&lsquo;Witness-attitude.&rsquo; It is perhaps the most esteemed of
all, and is represented in a good sculpture delineated
below (from Sir A. Cunningham&rsquo;s photograph, see
<a href="#Page_xxx">p. xxx</a>. 17). This represents Gautama at the moment of
achieving Buddhahood after his long course of meditation,
seated on a lion-throne (si&#7753;h&#257;sana) with an ornamental
back, having two lions carved below (compare
<a href="#Page_394">p. 394</a>). His legs are folded in the usual Indian
fashion, the feet being turned upwards, while the right
hand hangs over the right leg and points to the earth,
and the left hand is supinated on the left foot. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_479">479</span>
has an aureola round his head and a mark&mdash;perhaps
the caste-mark of a Kshatriya&mdash;on his forehead, and an
umbrella over the sacred tree. This attitude is well
shown in the S&#257;rn&#257;th sculpture (facing <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>).</p>
<p>The tradition is that at the moment of his enlightenment
Gautama was taunted by the evil being M&#257;ra with
being unable to give any proof or sign of his Buddhahood.
Thereupon Gautama pointed, not to heaven as
a Br&#257;hman might have done, but to the earth beneath
his feet, calling it to witness. Then a six-fold earthquake
and other miraculous phenomena followed<a class="fn" id="fr_253" href="#fn_253">[253]</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, too, the evil being M&#257;ra sent his
enchanting daughters (<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>) to seduce the Buddha.
This is shown in the engraving facing <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>.</p>
<p>The incident of calling the earth to witness is thus
mentioned by Hiouen Thsang:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Vih&#257;ra, was found a beautiful figure of Buddha in a sitting
position, the right foot uppermost, the left hand resting, the right
hand hanging down. He was sitting facing the east, and as dignified
in appearance as when alive. The signs and marks of a Buddha were
perfectly drawn. The loving expression of his face was like life.
Now it happened that a &#7776;rama&#7751;a, who was passing the night in the
Vih&#257;ra, had a dream, in which he saw a Br&#257;hman who said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am Maitreya Bodhi-sattva. Fearing that the mind of no artist
could conceive the beauty of the sacred features, I myself have come
to delineate the figure of Buddha. His right hand hangs down, in
token that when he was about to reach Buddhahood the evil M&#257;ra
came to tempt him, saying, &ldquo;Who will bear witness for you?&rdquo; Then
Tath&#257;gata dropped his hand and pointed to the ground, saying, &ldquo;Here
is my witness.&rdquo; On this an earth-spirit leapt forth to bear witness.&rsquo;
(Beal&rsquo;s Records, ii. 121, abridged.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &lsquo;Witness-attitude&rsquo; is also shown in the annexed
<span class="pb" id="Page_480">480</span>
engraving from a photograph of one of the only
statues that remained in the exterior niches of the
ancient Buddha-Gay&#257; temple before its restoration.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/i480.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="541" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>The two seal-like circles on each side contain the usual
&lsquo;Ye dharm&#257;&rsquo; formula (see <a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a> and <a href="#Page_xxx">p. xxx</a>. 18).</p>
<p>The third sedent pose or position may be called the
&lsquo;Serpent-canopied.&rsquo; This is commemorative of the
legend that Gautama, when seated in meditation after
his attainment of Buddhahood, was sheltered from a
violent storm by the expanded hood of the N&#257;ga, or
serpent-demon Mu&#263;alinda (see <a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>), while the coils of
the snake were wound round his body, or gathered
under him to form a seat. Similarly the ascetic form
of &#7776;iva is often represented under a serpent-canopy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_481">481</div>
<p>Only one example of this has been found at Buddha-Gay&#257;.
Such images, however, are common in the
south, and their prevalence there is not difficult to
account for. Indeed, the connexion of Buddhism with
the serpent-worship of southern countries and with the
N&#257;gas of Hind&#363; mythology (see <a href="#Page_220">p. 220</a> of these Lectures),
was one inevitable result of its readiness to
graft popular superstitions on its own doctrines<a class="fn" id="fr_254" href="#fn_254">[254]</a>.</p>
<p>I procured a good specimen of the &lsquo;Serpent-canopied&rsquo;
Buddha during my stay in Ceylon. It is made of heavy
brass, and curiously enough represents Buddha with
an aquiline nose. It has the five rays of light before
alluded to (see pp. <a href="#Page_453">453</a>, <a href="#Page_475">475</a>) issuing from the crown of
his head. See the frontispiece opposite title-page.</p>
<p>In some images an umbrella alone, and in some, as at
<a href="#Page_478">p. 478</a>, both an umbrella and tree form the canopy.</p>
<p>The fourth sedent posture may be called the
&lsquo;Argumentative&rsquo; (Tarka) attitude (as shown in the
engraving opposite <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>). It represents Gautama
with the thumb and finger of the right hand
touching the fingers of the left, and apparently going
through the heads of his doctrine<a class="fn" id="fr_255" href="#fn_255">[255]</a>, and enforcing
it, as he usually did, by reiterations. This is sometimes
called the &lsquo;Teaching&rsquo; attitude.</p>
<p>Often the &lsquo;Ye dharm&#257;&rsquo; formula (see <a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>) is carved
either under or at the side of images in this attitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_482">482</div>
<p>The fifth may be called the &lsquo;Preaching&rsquo; attitude. It
is often erect. The Buddha has one finger raised in a
didactic manner. Monks in the present day often
read the Law and preach in the same manner.</p>
<p>The sixth attitude also&mdash;as a rule&mdash;comes under the
erect class, and is often scarcely to be distinguished
from the last. It may be called the &lsquo;Benedictive&rsquo; attitude
(&#256;&#7777;irv&#257;da). See the engraving opposite <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>.</p>
<p>It represents the Buddha in the act of pronouncing
a benediction, the right hand being raised. This attitude
is sometimes sedent. Even to this day Buddhist
monks bless laymen in a similar attitude. Occasionally
the figure with the hand upraised has a crown, and
an ornamental head-dress; but it may be taken for
granted that all images of the Buddha which represent
him with a crown of any kind <i>after his attainment of
Buddhahood</i>, are comparatively modern and incorrect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is clear that even ancient
sculptures, when they represent him as a prince, may
correctly give him decorations and a head-dress.</p>
<p>The seventh attitude may be called the &lsquo;Mendicant.&rsquo;
This also is a standing figure, holding a round alms-bowl
in one hand, and sometimes screening it with the
other (compare <a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>). Examples of this attitude are
rare. There are no real mendicants in Buddhism. No
monk ever begs, he only receives alms.</p>
<p>The eighth and last attitude is recumbent, and this
is perhaps as important as the second, though not so
common (see the uppermost figure opposite to <a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>).
It represents the moribund Gautama lying down on
his right side, with his head turned towards the north,
<span class="pb" id="Page_483">483</span>
and his right cheek resting on his right hand, about
to pass away in the final consummation of Pari-nirv&#257;&#7751;a
(see pp. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>, <a href="#Page_140">140</a>). In many representations of this
attitude, the usual five rays of light often mentioned
before are made to issue from the crown of the head.
A colossal image of this kind was seen by me in a
temple near Colombo, and there is a good example of it
in the Indian Institute at Oxford<a class="fn" id="fr_256" href="#fn_256">[256]</a>. In some carvings
of the dying Buddha a few attendants are represented,
who hold umbrella-like canopies over the recumbent
figure, or bow down reverentially before it. It has
been asserted that this scene&mdash;as commemorative of
the grand consummation of the Buddha&rsquo;s career through
countless existences&mdash;is held in as much reverence by
Buddhists as the crucifixion is by Christians.</p>
<p>The representation of the Buddha in the act of being
born is found in sculptures and bas-reliefs, but is
never found as a separate image. It represents him
springing out of the side of his mother (<a href="#fn_85">note, p. 180</a>).
This birth-scene is occasionally carved on temples.
It is shown in the lower part of the engraving (opposite
<a href="#Page_477">page 477</a>). The god Brahm&#257; is seen receiving the
new-born child, while Indra stands on his right and
the mother&rsquo;s sister (i.e. nurse, <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>) is on her left.</p>
<p>Some representations of the Buddha, or of certain
forms of the Buddha&mdash;such as Amit&#257;bha&mdash;show a
sedent figure emerging from a lotus-blossom, or seated
on a pedestal formed of lotus-leaves, this flower symbolizing
perfection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_484">484</div>
<p>It must not be forgotten that in every country the
images of the Buddha are generally moulded according
to the type of countenance prevalent in each country.
Hence the contour and expression of face differ in
Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Tibet, Mongolia, China, and
Japan, although as a rule the features are calm, mild,
meditative, and passionless.</p>
<p>In Burma the people are merry; hence the images
sometimes have a twinkle in the eye and smiling lips.</p>
<p>In China, again, examples sometimes occur of images
which do not exhibit Buddha as the ideal of a man
who has conquered his passions, but rather with the
figure and features of a self-indulgent libertine<a class="fn" id="fr_257" href="#fn_257">[257]</a>; while
others again portray him with a grim aspect.</p>
<p>We now pass on to the representations of other
Buddhas, Bodhi-sattvas, saints, gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>Often two other images are associated with that of
Gautama Buddha himself.</p>
<p>And, first of all, his image was joined with the other
two persons of the earliest Triad (see <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>), viz. Dharma
(the Law) and Sa&#7749;gha (the Monkhood). A sculpture, in
a broken and imperfect condition, representing this
earliest Triad, and dating from the ninth to the tenth
century, was found at Buddha-Gay&#257;. The image of
Buddha, under an umbrella-like tree, is in the centre;
that of the Sa&#7749;gha is on his right, with a full-blown
<span class="pb" id="Page_485">485</span>
lotus (<a href="#fn_82">p. 177, note 2</a>), and having one leg hanging down,
while that of Dharma (a female) is on his left with
a half-blown lotus. A drawing of this (from Sir A.
Cunningham&rsquo;s photograph) is given below:&mdash;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/i485.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="343" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>In Nep&#257;l the image of Dharma is always that of a
sedent female, who is supposed to be an embodiment
of supreme wisdom (praj&ntilde;&#257; p&#257;ramit&#257;), and sometimes
has four arms (see <a href="#fn_83">note, p. 178</a>).</p>
<p>Next come the images of the Buddhas who preceded
Gautama, especially K&#257;&#7777;yapa Buddha, Kanaka-muni,
and Kraku-&#263;&#263;handa. It is often mentioned that the
images of one or other of these three, as of the Bodhi-sattvas,
are set up side by side with that of Gautama.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there are the images of the five
Dhy&#257;ni-Buddhas. Perhaps the commonest of these is
that of Amit&#257;bha (see <a href="#Page_203">p. 203</a>), but images of Akshobhya
and Ratna-sambhava are by no means rare.</p>
<p>Then as to the Bodhi-sattvas, of whom Maitreya is
the first and the only one worshipped by Buddhists of
<span class="pb" id="Page_486">486</span>
all countries (see <a href="#Page_182">p. 182</a>), F&#257;-hien records that he saw
in Northern India a wooden image of Maitreya Bodhi-sattva
eighty cubits high, which on fast days emitted
a brilliant light. Offerings were constantly presented
to it by the kings of surrounding countries (Legge, 23).</p>
<p>Hiouen Thsang (Beal, i. 134) also describes this
image of Maitreya as very dazzling, and says it was
the work of the Arhat Madhy&#257;ntika, a disciple of
&#256;nanda. He saw another image of Maitreya made
of silver at Buddha-Gay&#257;, and another made of sandal-wood
in Western India. The latter also gave out a
bright light. Probably these images were covered with
some kind of gilding.</p>
<p>In the present day the images of Maitreya often
represent him with both hands raised, the fingers forming
the lotus-shaped Mudr&#257;, the body yellow or gilded,
and the hair short and curly.</p>
<p>Passing next to the images of the triad of mythical
Bodhi-sattvas, Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299;, Avalokite&#7777;vara, and Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i
(<a href="#Page_195">p. 195</a>), we may gather from what has been
already stated (<a href="#Page_196">p. 196</a>), that the interaction of Buddhism
and Hind&#363;ism affected both the mythology and
imagery of both systems. Yet it does not appear that
the images of the Bodhi-sattva Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299; were ever
unnaturally distorted. They are quite as human and
pleasant in appearance as those of Gautama and Maitreya.
In general Ma&ntilde;ju-&#7777;r&#299; represented in a sedent
attitude, with his left hand holding a lotus, and his
right holding the sword of wisdom, with a shining
blade to dissipate the darkness of ignorance (see <a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>).
His body ought to be yellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_487">487</div>
<p>It was not till the introduction of the worship of
Avalokite&#7777;vara that the followers of Buddha thought of
endowing the figures of deified saints with an extra
number of heads and arms.</p>
<p>The process of Avalokite&#7777;vara&rsquo;s (Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i&rsquo;s) creation
and the formation of his numerous heads by the
Dhy&#257;ni-Buddha Amit&#257;bha, is thus described (Schlagintweit,
p. 84, abridged):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time Amit&#257;bha, after giving himself up to earnest
meditation, caused a red ray of light to issue from his right eye, which
brought Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i Bodhi-sattva into existence; while from his left
eye burst forth a blue ray of light, which becoming incarnate in the
two wives of King Srong Tsan (see <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>), had power to enlighten the
minds of human beings. Amit&#257;bha then blessed Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i&rsquo;s Bodhi-sattva
by laying his hands upon him, so that by virtue of this benediction,
he brought forth the prayer &lsquo;Om ma&#7751;i padme H&#363;m.&rsquo; Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i
then made a solemn vow to rescue all the beings in hell from
their pains, saying to himself:&mdash;&lsquo;If I fail, may my head split into
a thousand pieces!&rsquo; After remaining absorbed in contemplation for
some time, he proceeded to the various hells, expecting to find that the
inhabitants, through the efficacy of his meditations, had ascended to
the higher worlds. And this indeed he found they had done. But
no sooner was their release accomplished than all the hells again
became as full as ever, the places of the out-going tenants being
supplied by an equal number of new-comers. This so astounded the
unhappy Bodhi-sattva that his head instantly split into a thousand
pieces. Then Amit&#257;bha, deeply moved by his son&rsquo;s misfortune,
hastened to his assistance, and formed the thousand pieces into ten
heads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schlagintweit states, and I have myself observed,
that Avalokite&#7777;vara&rsquo;s eleven heads are generally represented
as forming a pyramid, and are ranged in four
rows. Each series of heads has a particular complexion.
The three faces resting on the neck are white, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_488">488</span>
three above yellow, the next three red, the tenth blue,
and the eleventh&mdash;that is, the head of his father Amit&#257;bha
at the top of all<a class="fn" id="fr_258" href="#fn_258">[258]</a>&mdash;is red. In Japanese images
the heads are much smaller, and are arranged like a
crown, the centre of which is formed by two entire
figures, the lower one sitting, the other standing above
it. Ten small heads are combined with these two
figures.</p>
<p>The number of Avalokite&#7777;vara&rsquo;s hands ought to
amount to a thousand, and he is called &lsquo;a thousand-eyed,&rsquo;
as having the eye of wisdom on each palm. Of
course all these thousand arms and eyes cannot be
represented in images. Still there is an idol in the
British Museum which represents him with about forty
arms, two of which have the hands joined in an attitude
of worship.</p>
<p>A remarkable description of an image of Avalokite&#7777;vara
seen by Sarat Chandra D&#257;s (so recently as
1882) in the great temple at Lh&#257;ssa occurs in his &lsquo;Narrative&rsquo;
(which I here abridge):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next to the image of Buddha, the most conspicuous figure was that
of Chanrassig (i. e. the eleven-faced Avalokite&#7777;vara). The origin of
this is ascribed to King Sron Tsan Gampo (<a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a> of this volume).
Once the king heard a voice from heaven, saying that if he constructed
an image of Avalokite&#7777;vara of the size of his own person, all his
desires would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Thereupon he proceeded to do so, and the materials he used were
a branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree, a portion of the Vajr&#257;sana, some
soil from an oceanic island, some sand from the river Naira&ntilde;jana, some
pith of Go&#7777;&#299;rsha sandal-wood, a portion of the soil of the eight sacred
<span class="pb" id="Page_489">489</span>
places of ancient India, and many other rare articles pounded together
and made into paste, with the milk of a red cow and a she-goat. This
paste the king touched with his head, and prayed to the all-knowing
Buddhas and the host of Bodhi-sattvas, that by the merit of making
that image, there might be god-speed to the great work he had undertaken&mdash;namely,
the diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet.</p>
<p>The gods, Buddhas, saints, etc. filled the aerial space to listen to his
prayer.</p>
<p>The king then ordered the Nep&#257;lese artist to hasten the completion
of the image, and with a view of heightening its sanctity, obtained
a sandal-wood image of Avalokite&#7777;vara from Ceylon and inserted it
inside, together with the relics of the seven past Buddhas. When the
work was finished, the artist said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sire, I cannot say that I have made this image, it has passed into
self-grown existence.&rsquo; Then a current of lightning flashed forth from
its feet. Afterwards, the souls of the king and his queen are said to
have been absorbed into it, in consequence of which this image is
called &lsquo;the five-absorbed self-sprung.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is recorded in another tradition that a wonder-working
image of Avalokite&#7777;vara was set up in a
monastery near Kabul, and another in Magadha near
the Ganges. Any worshipper who approached these
idols in devotion and faith were favoured with a
personal vision of the saint. The statues opened, and
the Bodhi-sattva emerged in bright rays of light (compare
Koeppen, i. p. 499).</p>
<p>Originally, and still in Tibet, Avalokite&#7777;vara (otherwise
called Padma-p&#257;&#7751;i) had only male attributes; but
in China this deity (as we have already mentioned at
<a href="#Page_200">p. 200</a>) is represented as a woman, called Kwan-yin
(in Japan Kwan-non), with a thousand arms and a thousand
eyes. She has her principal seat in the island of
Poo-too, on the coast of China, which is a place of pilgrimage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_490">490</div>
<p>There are two images of Kwan-yin in the British
Museum, one with sixteen arms and the other with
eight.</p>
<p>Images of the third mythical Bodhi-sattva&mdash;the
fierce Vajra-p&#257;&#7751;i, &lsquo;holding a thunderbolt in one hand&rsquo;&mdash;like
one form of &#7776;iva&mdash;are almost as common as those
of the merciful and mild Avalokite&#7777;vara. He has been
described in a previous Lecture (<a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>).</p>
<p>In the Pitt-Rivers collection at Oxford there is an
image of this Bodhi-sattva engaged in combating the
power of evil. It is remarkable that the figures of
three monkeys are carved underneath, one stopping his
ears with his hands, another stopping his eyes, and
another his mouth, to symbolize the effort to prevent
the entrance of evil desires through the three most
important organs of sense.</p>
<p>With regard to the images of female deities we may
observe that T&#257;r&#257;, the wife or &#7776;akti of Amogha-siddha
(<a href="#Page_216">p. 216</a>), is represented as a green sedent figure;
her right hand on her knee, her left holding a
lotus.</p>
<p>A standing image of the goddess Pa&#7789;&#7789;in&#299; (<a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a> of
this volume) may be seen in the British Museum.</p>
<p>In a temple which I visited near D&#257;rj&#299;ling I saw
the image of the Padma-sambhava or &lsquo;lotus-born&rsquo; form
of Buddha occupying the centre of the altar, with the
images of Gautama Buddha and of Buddha &#256;yushmat,
or the &lsquo;Buddha of Life,&rsquo; on each side.</p>
<p>Sir R. Temple (Journal, p. 212) relates how in a
chamber of a Sikkim monastery there were three
figures, the central of which, with a fair complexion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_491">491</span>
was Amit&#257;bha, that on its right Gautama Buddha, and
on its left Gorakh-n&#257;th (see <a href="#Page_193">p. 193</a> of this volume).</p>
<p>In the monastery of Galdan (<a href="#Page_441">p. 441</a>) Mr. Sarat
Chandra D&#257;s saw the golden image of Tsong Khapa
(with his golden chain and his tooth and his block-prints),
along with the images of Amit&#257;bha, Gautama,
Maitreya, Bhairava (the awful defender of Buddhism),
Yama &lsquo;the lord of death,&rsquo; and his terrific messengers.</p>
<p>In the great Cho Khang at Lh&#257;ssa (see <a href="#Page_459">p. 459</a>) he saw
images of Avalokite&#7777;vara, Ma&ntilde;ju-sr&#299;, Maitreya, Kuvera,
Padma-sambhava, with an immense number of others,
and especially one of the terrific goddess Paldan (or
Pandan) who is feared all over Tibet, Mongolia, and
China, as the greatest guardian deity of the Dalai and
Tashi L&#257;mas and of the Buddhist Dharma. He found
her shrine infested with mice, who are believed to be
metamorphosed monks.</p>
<p>At Sera (<a href="#Page_442">p. 442</a>) he saw images of the Buddha
in his character of &lsquo;demon-vanquisher,&rsquo; along with
Maitreya (in silver), Avalokite&#7777;vara, the six-armed
Bhairava, the goddess K&#257;l&#299;, Dolkar (= T&#257;r&#257;, <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>),
the T&#257;ntrik Vajra-v&#257;r&#257;h&#299;, the sixteen Sthaviras
(pp. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, <a href="#Page_255">255</a>), and a great variety of others.</p>
<p>At Radeng (<a href="#Page_273">p. 273</a>) he saw a golden image of Milaraspa
(<a href="#Page_384">p. 384</a>).</p>
<p>In the monastery of Sam ye (<a href="#Page_448">p. 448</a>) he saw
images of the Indian Pa&#7751;&#7693;its who brought Buddhism
into Tibet, with a vast number of other images.</p>
<p>At Tashi Lunpo he saw golden images of Buddha
and Maitreya, besides images of 1000 other Buddhas
(<a href="#Page_189">p. 189</a>), and the four guardians of the quarters (<a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_492">492</div>
<p>At Yarlung he saw an image of Vairo&#263;ana Buddha,
besides images of the sixteen Sthaviras, and a gigantic
image of the king of the N&#257;gas, and a terrific representation
of the demon R&#257;va&#7751;a (of the R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a).</p>
<p>At Mindolling he saw fresco paintings of the six
classes of beings (<a href="#Page_122">p. 122</a>) inhabiting the six corresponding
worlds. Of course delineations of the J&#257;takas
(<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>) and pictures of all kinds were common in monasteries
and temples everywhere.</p>
<p>The two wonder-working images brought from Nep&#257;l
and China have been already mentioned (<a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>).</p>
<p>As an illustration of the monstrous superstition and
idolatry prevalent in modern Buddhist countries, I
venture, in conclusion, to quote, with abridgment, the
following description of an idol seen by Miss Bird in
Japan (see her &lsquo;Unbeaten Tracks in Japan,&rsquo; published
by Mr. Murray):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one shrine is a large idol spotted all over with pellets of paper,
and hundreds of these may be seen sticking to the wire-netting which
protects him. A worshipper writes his petition on paper, or, better
still, has it written for him by the priest, chews it to a pulp and spits
it at the divinity. If, having been well aimed, it passes through the
wire and sticks, it is a good omen, if it lodges in the netting the
prayer has probably been unheard.</p>
<p>On the left there is a shrine with a screen, to which innumerable
prayers have been tied. On the right sits one of Buddha&rsquo;s original
sixteen disciples (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a> of these Lectures). A Koolie with a
swelled knee applied it to the knee of the idol, while one with
inflamed eyelids rubbed his eyelids on it!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_493">493</div>
<h2 id="c22">LECTURE XVII.
<br /><i>Sacred Objects.</i></h2>
<p>Next to the subject of images and idols comes that
of certain sacred objects which Buddhists of all Schools&mdash;whether
adherents of the H&#299;na-y&#257;na or Mah&#257;-y&#257;na
systems&mdash;hold in veneration; for example, relics, relic-receptacles
or St&#363;pas, foot-prints, trees, utensils, bells,
symbols, and animals.</p>
<p>The narratives of the Chinese travellers, frequently
mentioned before, teem with descriptions of such objects.
Take, for instance, F&#257;-hien&rsquo;s account of the district
of Nag&#257;ra, near Peshawar in Northern India
(Legge, 34-40), in which several sacred objects are
stated to exist&mdash;such as a fragment of Buddha&rsquo;s skull,
one of his teeth, portions of his hair and nails, his alms-bowl,
his staff (contained in a wooden tube, so heavy
that even a thousand men could not lift it), his robe,
and the impression of his shadow. This was at the
beginning of the fifth century of our era.</p>
<p>F&#257;-hien&rsquo;s statements are confirmed by Sung-Yun, the
next Chinese traveller mentioned before (<a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a> of this
volume<a class="fn" id="fr_259" href="#fn_259">[259]</a>), who started on his journey rather more than
a century after F&#257;-hien.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We then visited the Ki-Ka-lam temple near Nag&#257;ra. This contains
the yellow robe (Kash&#257;ya) of Buddha in thirteen pieces. Here also is
<span class="pb" id="Page_494">494</span>
the staff of Buddha, in a wooden case covered with gold-leaf. The
weight of this staff is sometimes so heavy that a hundred men cannot
raise it, and at other times it is so light that one man can lift it. In
the city of Na-kie (Nagarah&#257;ra) is a tooth of Buddha and also some of
his hair, both of which are contained in precious caskets. Morning
and evening religious offerings are made to them.</p>
<p>We next arrive at the cave of Go-p&#257;la, where is the shadow of
Buddha. To anyone entering the cavern, and looking for a long time
(or, from a long distance) at the western side of it opposite the door, the
figure, with its characteristic marks, appears; on going nearer, it
gradually grows fainter and then disappears. On touching the place
where it was, there is nothing but the bare wall. Gradually retreating,
the figure begins to come in view again, and foremost is conspicuous
that peculiar mark between the eyebrows (&#363;r&#7751;a), which is so
rare among men.</p>
<p>Before the cave is a square stone, on which is a trace of Buddha&rsquo;s
foot (Beal&rsquo;s Translation, p. cvii, abridged).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hiouen Thsang, the third traveller, confirms the
statements of his predecessors in regard to the relics
in this district, and adds as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is another little St&#363;pa, made of the seven precious substances,
in which is deposited the <i>eye-ball</i> of the Buddha, large as an &#256;mra
fruit, and bright and clear throughout. It is deposited in a sealed-up
casket (Beal, i. 96).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to perceive from the above extracts that
the worship of certain sacred objects connected with
the founder of Buddhism had become even in F&#257;-hien&rsquo;s
time a marked feature of Buddhism. In fact, the number
of such objects increased so rapidly that before long
it became usual to classify them under three heads as
follow<a class="fn" id="fr_260" href="#fn_260">[260]</a>:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) &#7776;&#257;r&#299;rika (or &#7776;ar&#299;ra-dh&#257;tu or simply &#7776;&#257;r&#299;ra), objects
<span class="pb" id="Page_495">495</span>
which once formed part of the Buddha&rsquo;s body, such as
a bone, a tooth, a hair, a nail.</p>
<p>(2) P&#257;ribhogika, &lsquo;objects possessed or used by the
Buddha,&rsquo; such as his seat, alms-bowl, drinking-vessel
(kumbha), staff, vestments, and even his spittoon.
Under this division is placed the Bodhi-tree.</p>
<p>(3) Udde&#7777;ika, objects worshipped as in some way
commemorative of the Buddha or of some event or incident
in his life.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to decide under which of these
categories the <i>sacred books</i> containing the Buddha&rsquo;s
Law are to be placed, and yet they are deeply revered,
and at the present day almost deified, as if they were
intelligent and omniscient beings. They are wrapped
in costly cloth or silk, and their names are mentioned
with the addition of honorific personal titles. Occasionally
such sacred books are placed on a kind of rude altar,
near the road-side, that passers-by may place offerings
of money upon them<a class="fn" id="fr_261" href="#fn_261">[261]</a>.</p>
<p>Without attempting, therefore, to follow any particular
classification, we proceed to notice some of the
chief objects in the order of their importance, beginning
with relics.</p>
<h3><i>Relics.</i></h3>
<p>Adoration of relics constitutes an important point of
difference between Buddhism and Br&#257;hmanism; for
Br&#257;hmanism and its offspring Hind&#363;ism are wholly
opposed to the practice of preserving the ashes, bones,
<span class="pb" id="Page_496">496</span>
hair, or teeth of deceased persons, however much such
individuals may have been revered during life.</p>
<p>I remarked in the course of my travels through India
that articles used by great religious teachers&mdash;as, for
example, robes, wooden shoes, and seats&mdash;are sometimes
preserved and venerated after their death. All articles
of this kind, however, must, of course, be removed from
the body before actual decease; for it is well known
that, in the minds of Hind&#363;s, ideas of impurity are inseparably
connected with death, and contamination is
supposed to result from contact with the corpses of
even a man&rsquo;s dearest relatives. Nor is the mortal
frame ever held in veneration by the Hind&#363;s as it was
by the ancient Egyptians, and as it generally is in
Christian countries.</p>
<p>Even the living body is regarded as a mass of corruption,
a thing to be held in contempt, and a constant
impediment to sanctity of life. How much more then
ought every part of a dead body to be got rid of without
delay! Hence in the present day a corpse is burnt,
and its ashes are generally scattered on the surface of
sacred rivers or of the sea.</p>
<p>It is true that the bodies of great Hind&#363; ascetics
and devotees are exempted from this rule. They are
usually buried&mdash;not burnt. Not, however, because the
mere corporeal frame is held in greater veneration, but
because the bodies of the most eminent saints are supposed
to lie undecomposed in a kind of trance, or state
of intense ecstatic meditation (sam&#257;dhi).</p>
<p>The Buddhist, too, is a thorough Hind&#363; in contemning
the living body; but when the corpse is burnt, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_497">497</span>
does not scatter the ashes on rivers. He takes measures
to preserve them.</p>
<p>We know that according to the teaching of Br&#257;hmanism
the burning of a corpse is followed by religious
ceremonies called &#7776;r&#257;ddhas<a class="fn" id="fr_262" href="#fn_262">[262]</a>. The greater the number
of &#7776;r&#257;ddhas which a living man is able to perform in
behalf of his deceased relatives, the greater is the
benefit which accrues to their souls; and if the dead
man&rsquo;s soul happens to be in one of the hells, the sooner
it is released from its purgatorial pains.</p>
<p>A true Buddhist, on the other hand, considers all
such &#7776;r&#257;ddhas as useless; although it is certainly a
fact that in the end the more developed Buddhism of
the North invented similar ceremonies, called Bardo
(see pp. <a href="#Page_293">293</a>, <a href="#Page_334">334</a>).</p>
<p>True Buddhism, in short, has only one way of honouring
ancestors, and only one method of keeping alive
the memory of those perfected saints whose whole personality
has become extinct, and whose transition into
other forms of life has finally ceased.</p>
<p>The calcined ashes, or certain unconsumed portions
of the body&mdash;such as fragments of bone or hair or nails
or teeth&mdash;are deposited in relic-shrines.</p>
<p>Of course the most sacred of all Buddhist relics are
those of the Buddha himself. It is said that after the
cremation of his corpse the chief remains consisted of
four teeth, the two cheek-bones, and fragments of the
skull. But it is believed that, even before his death,
portions of his hair and nails were preserved and placed
<span class="pb" id="Page_498">498</span>
under D&#257;gabas (St&#363;pas). One legend relates that when
Gautama had decided on abandoning all worldly associations,
his first act was to cut off the mass of his hair,
with its ornament (&#263;&#363;&#7693;&#257;-ma&#7751;i), and that these were
taken up by the god Indra to the Trayastri&#7753;&#7777;a heaven,
and there placed under a D&#257;gaba and worshipped by
the gods.</p>
<p>F&#257;-hien, in a passage already alluded to, says that
in the country of Nag&#257;ra there is a particular spot
where Buddha shaved off his hair and clipt his nails,
and, having done so, proceeded to erect a lofty mound
or St&#363;pa to enshrine them, as well as to be a model
for all future St&#363;pas (<a href="#Page_504">p. 504</a> of this volume).</p>
<p>Hiouen Thsang relates a tradition that when the two
travelling merchants Trapusha and Bhallika (see <a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>)
were converted, the Buddha gave them at their own
request some of his own hair and nail-parings, besides
his alms-bowl, staff, and a portion of his clothing, and
bade them deposit each article in St&#363;pas or D&#257;gabas.
The two merchants, it is narrated, went home to their
own country and acquired an enormous stock of religious
merit by being the first to erect a St&#363;pa for the reception
of personal memorials of the great Buddha. According
to a tradition the two merchants were from
Burma, and the shrine which was erected to receive
eight of his hairs afterwards developed into the great
Rangoon D&#257;gaba (Pagoda). It may be inferred from this
legend (as Dr. Oldenberg has already remarked) that
the care of the Buddha&rsquo;s relics, and the institution of
ceremonies in their honour, were in the first instance left
to the devotion of religiously minded Buddhist laymen.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_499">499</div>
<p>&lsquo;What are we to do,&rsquo; &#256;nanda asks of the Master, when his end is
drawing near<a class="fn" id="fr_263" href="#fn_263">[263]</a>, &lsquo;with the body of the Perfect One?&rsquo; &lsquo;Let not the
honours due to the body of the Perfect One trouble you, &#256;nanda.
Seek ye rather perfection for yourselves. There are, &#256;nanda, wise
men among the nobles, the Br&#257;hmans, and the citizens, who believe in
the Perfect One; they will honour the body of the Perfect One.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hiouen Thsang (Beal, ii. 40) also states that when
certain Indian R&#257;jas, eight in number, heard of the
Buddha&rsquo;s death, they collected armies and marched
to Kusi-n&#257;r&#257; (<a href="#Page_424">p. 424</a>) to seize portions of the relics;
but the prince of Kusi-n&#257;r&#257; refused to give them up.
In the end the matter was settled amicably, and the
relics were divided, so that each of the eight princes
might take a share. Then all departed to their own
homes, and each prince built a St&#363;pa over his own portion
of the relics. The gods also took their portions.</p>
<p>F&#257;-hien (chap. xxiii) alludes to the building of the
eight St&#363;pas, and adds that king A&#7777;oka destroyed
them, and in their place built 84,000 others&mdash;one for
the conservation of each atom of the elements of the
Buddha&rsquo;s body; the belief being that the bodies of all
human beings consist of that number of elementary particles
(see <a href="#Page_423">p. 423</a>). The eight-fold division is described
in &lsquo;Buddhist Suttas,&rsquo; pp. 133-136 (S. B. E. vol. xi).</p>
<p>It appears probable that the earliest relics of his
burnt body held in honour were his teeth; and of
these again the most celebrated seem to have been his
<span class="pb" id="Page_500">500</span>
four eye-teeth. One of the four is said to have been
appropriated by the gods and another by the N&#257;gas,
while the third was taken to G&#257;ndh&#257;ra in the north-west,
and the fourth to Kali&#7749;ga in the south-east.</p>
<p>The first two eye-teeth have only mythical histories,
and little is recorded of the third, but the fourth has
gone through a series of terrestrial adventures, which
have been much written about and would fill several
volumes. One of the immediate followers of Gautama
is said to have gained possession of it on the occasion
of the eight-fold distribution of the great sage&rsquo;s relics
(<a href="#Page_499">p. 499</a>), and to have conveyed it to a place afterwards
called Danta-pura, &lsquo;tooth-city<a class="fn" id="fr_264" href="#fn_264">[264]</a>,&rsquo; the capital of Kali&#7749;ga
(Orissa), where it is believed to have remained undisturbed
for about 800 years. After that period it was
seized, at the instigation of some Br&#257;hmans, by a powerful
Hind&#363; king who reigned at P&#257;&#7789;aliputra. Its vicissitudes
and adventures for centuries afterwards were
very varied. It was conveyed surreptitiously to Ceylon
about the year 311 of our era by a princess of Kali&#7749;ga,
who concealed it in her hair. There it remained till
1315, when it was carried back to Southern India.
After a time it was taken back to Kandy in Ceylon.
Next it was seized by the Portuguese and carried off to
Goa. Thence it was transported to Pegu, and finally
the precious tooth-relic (d&#257;&#7789;h&#257;-dh&#257;tu), or at least some
imitation of it, was restored to the good people of
<span class="pb" id="Page_501">501</span>
Kandy, where it is still preserved by them as a veritable
Palladium, with every possible precaution against
further outrage, although under the protecting &aelig;gis of
our government its security ought not any longer to be
matter of anxiety.</p>
<p>Every native of Ceylon (La&#7749;k&#257;), whether Buddhist
or Hind&#363;, seems to feel that the welfare of his country
depends on its careful conservation. At any rate the
Sinhalese have placed their tooth-temple&mdash;called Dalada
M&#257;lig&#257;wa&mdash;in the loveliest part of their beautiful
island (see <a href="#Page_454">p. 454</a>), amid richly wooded hills, from which
may be obtained some of the most enchanting views in
the world. The eye-tooth is in appearance like a piece
of discoloured ivory about two inches<a class="fn" id="fr_265" href="#fn_265">[265]</a> long, and
one inch across in the thickest part. Indeed, all the
supposed relics of the Buddha&rsquo;s body, and the dress and
implements he used, are of such a size as to make his
worshippers believe that his stature far exceeded that
of ordinary men.</p>
<p>The tooth is enclosed in nine bell-shaped, jewelled
golden cases, one within the other, each locked by a
key, and each key consigned to the custody of a separate
official. The interior cases increase in costliness
till the most highly jewelled of all is reached, and
within this on a golden lotus lies the relic. When I
visited the tooth-temple in 1877, the cases were kept
within iron bars in a dimly-lighted shrine&mdash;redolent
with flower-offerings which exhaled an overpowering
<span class="pb" id="Page_502">502</span>
perfume&mdash;and in the very centre of the buildings of
the temple. When the Prince of Wales visited Kandy
in 1876, all the officials assembled to unlock the cases
and exhibit the treasured relic.</p>
<p>A detailed account of the tooth is given in a book
called Dalada-va&#7753;&#7777;a or D&#257;&#7789;h&#257;-va&#7753;&#7777;a, said to have been
written originally in ancient Sinhalese (Elu) about the
year 310 of our era, and translated into the sacred P&#257;li
about the year 1200. This book has been rendered
into English by the late Sir Coom&#257;ra Sw&#257;my. The
tooth is also described in many other P&#257;li and Sinhalese
books, including the Mah&#257;-va&#7753;&#7777;a.</p>
<p>And here it may be remarked that one feature of the
Buddha&rsquo;s relics was that they gave forth on special occasions
celestial light, and had the power of working
miracles. Sometimes a reverent circumambulation of
the shrine which contained the relics was believed to be
sufficiently efficacious in stimulating their miraculous
powers. Sometimes they were taken out and exhibited.
The following extract from F&#257;-hien reminds one
of what takes place at Kandy in the present day:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the city of He-lo (the present Hi&#7693;&#7693;a, west of Peshawar) there is
the flat-bone of Buddha&rsquo;s skull, deposited in a Vih&#257;ra adorned all over
with gold-leaf and the seven sacred substances. The king of the
country revering the bone, and anxious lest it should be stolen, has
selected eight individuals representing great families, and committed
to each a seal with which he should seal the shrine and guard the
relic. At early dawn these men come, and after each has inspected
his seal, they open the door. This done they wash their hands with
scented water, and bring out the bone, which they place on a lofty
platform, where it is supported on a pedestal of the seven precious
substances. The king every morning makes his offerings and performs
his worship. The chiefs of the Vai&#7777;yas also make their offerings.
<span class="pb" id="Page_503">503</span>
Then they replace the bone in the Vih&#257;ra, under a St&#363;pa of the seven
precious substances (<a href="#Page_528">p. 528</a> of this volume) more than five cubits high
(Legge, pp. 36-38, abridged).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>F&#257;-hien records a similar exhibition of the Buddha&rsquo;s
alms-bowl in the country near Peshawar:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it is mid-day they bring out the bowl and make offerings to
it. It may contain about two pecks, and it has a bright lustre. When
poor people throw into it a few flowers, it becomes full. If the rich
throw in myriads of flowers, they are not able to fill it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He states that the Buddha&rsquo;s robe was also brought
out to be worshipped:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there is a drought the people collect in crowds, bring out the
robe, pay worship to it and make offerings, on which there is immediately
a great rain from the sky (Legge, pp. 35, 39, abridged).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The relics of all great saints in Buddhist countries
were revered in a similar manner. At the same time
it ought to be noted that the periodical exhibition of
relics, before the eyes of worshippers, was not a usual
occurrence (as it is in Roman Catholic countries). Indeed,
as a general rule, the custom seems to have been
to shield the ashes and remains of revered dead bodies
from observation and liability to be touched. Hence
they were commonly sealed up hermetically, as it were,
in the interior of receptacles which effectually concealed
them from view and protected them from disturbance.</p>
<p>And this leads us to advert to the form and character
of Buddhist relic-receptacles.</p>
<p>It is probable that at a very early period, and even
before the Buddha&rsquo;s time, the Hind&#363;s were accustomed
to raise heaps or tumuli over the ashes of kings, great
men, saints and sages, just as even to this day among
the Sikhs of the Panj&#257;b, the ashes of great men are so
<span class="pb" id="Page_504">504</span>
honoured. Some think that the hemispherical dome-like
form of the tumulus was intended to represent a
bubble&mdash;the most transitory of all material objects. In
all likelihood the dome of the S&#257;&ntilde;ch&#299; St&#363;pa&mdash;which is
thought to be as old as the time of Buddha&mdash;was constructed
in memory of some great man.</p>
<p>Such heaps were at first generally called &#262;aityas,
and afterwards St&#363;pas (from the Sansk&#7771;it roots &#263;i
and styai, meaning &lsquo;to heap together&rsquo;); but &#262;aitya
ultimately denoted a relic-structure in an assembly-hall
(see <a href="#Page_450">p. 450</a>), while the word St&#363;pa denoted one in
the open air. Then inside the &#262;aitya or St&#363;pa (P&#257;li
Th&#363;pa, corrupted into Tope) there was a casket&mdash;made
of silver, gold, stone, earthenware, etc.&mdash;in which
were deposited the ashes, fragments of bone, or the
teeth or nails of the deceased. And this relic-casket
was called in Sansk&#7771;it Dh&#257;tu-garbha, or in P&#257;li D&#257;gaba
(corrupted into Dagoba and afterwards into Pagoda)&mdash;that
is, a repository of the elementary particles of which
all bodies are composed.</p>
<p>Then in time the word D&#257;gaba (Pagoda) denoted the
monument as well as the relic-casket. Moreover &#262;aityas
and St&#363;pas were often mere pyramidal structures,
enshrining images or marking important events (see
<a href="#Page_390">p. 390</a>), but not containing relics. Among the Hind&#363;s
&#262;aitya often denotes the sacred village-tree planted on
a mound.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/i505.jpg" alt="VOTIVE ST&#362;PA, RECENTLY FOUND AT BUDDHA-GAY&#256;." width="350" height="705" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">VOTIVE ST&#362;PA, RECENTLY FOUND AT BUDDHA-GAY&#256;.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="center">(Date about ninth or tenth century of our era.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_505">505</div>
<p>The process by which the simple &#262;aitya or mound
developed into more elaborate structures is remarkable.
First came erections of stone or brick, generally bell-shaped
or domed like bee-hives. These again expanded
into elongated pyramidal structures, springing
from cylindrical or octagonal or hexagonal bases, and ornamented
with images of Gautama, and resting on plinth-like
foundations, the summits tapering into finials consisting
of three, or seven, or nine, or eleven, or even fifteen
tiers of umbrella-shaped ornaments (see <a href="#fn_194">note, p. 393</a>).</p>
<p>Then, again, in time, these elaborate D&#257;gabas expanded
into vast Pagodas of enormous height, as, for example,
the Rangoon Pagoda (see <a href="#Page_456">p. 456</a>) and that at Anur&#257;dha-pura
in Ceylon.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether in early Buddhism &#262;aityas
and St&#363;pas were ever empty monuments or cenotaphs.
Probably all of them contained ashes, fragments of
bone, teeth, or hair, though in some cases the most
careful examination has failed to discover the vessel
in which they were deposited. If made of fragile
materials, it rapidly crumbled into dust. But St&#363;pas,
even without relics, were themselves objects of reverence.</p>
<p>In the later period of Buddhism the practice of
carving, or moulding mere memorial or votive St&#363;pas,
and dedicating them at sacred spots became common.
The examples of this kind of St&#363;pa which I saw unearthed
at Buddha-Gay&#257; have been described (<a href="#Page_397">p. 397</a>).</p>
<p>The engraving opposite to this page is a copy of
one of these votive St&#363;pas which I procured for the
Indian Institute through Mr. Beglar.</p>
<p>At Mandalay there is a large Pagoda with about
620 smaller ones round it (in rows of six or seven deep).
Each small Pagoda enshrines a tablet&mdash;exposed to
view&mdash;on which some portion of the Law is engraved.
<span class="pb" id="Page_506">506</span>
Many small Pagodas are simply canopies of brick or
some solid material erected over images.</p>
<p>Outside the Buddhist convent near D&#257;rj&#299;ling, when
I visited it in 1884, a monk was roughly moulding
a number of small votive St&#363;pas in clay, with which
he was probably mixing the powdered bones of some
deceased L&#257;ma. Here is a copy of one exactly the size
of the original:&mdash;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/i506.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="627" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"></span></p>
</div>
<p>If broken open, a terra-cotta seal, inscribed with some
sacred formula, would probably be found inside.</p>
<p>Of course most of the Buddha&rsquo;s chief disciples, such
as S&#257;riputta, Maudgaly&#257;yana, K&#257;&#7777;yapa, &#256;nanda, Up&#257;li,
each had St&#363;pas erected over their relics.</p>
<h3><i>Sacred Foot-prints.</i></h3>
<p>Next in importance to the worship of relics is that
of foot-prints (Sansk&#7771;it &#7776;r&#299;-pada or &#7776;r&#299;-p&#257;da). Everywhere
throughout Buddhist countries the supposed
impressions of the Buddha&rsquo;s feet are as much honoured
as those of the god Vish&#7751;u are by Vaish&#7751;avas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_507">507</div>
<p>When F&#257;-hien reached G&#7771;idhra-k&#363;&#7789;a (see
pp. <a href="#Page_404">404</a>, <a href="#Page_406">406</a>), he is said to have used words to the following
effect: &lsquo;I, F&#257;-hien, was born when I could not meet
with Buddha, and now I only see the foot-prints which
he has left&rsquo; (Legge, 83).</p>
<p>It is well known that the practice of bowing down
and honouring the feet is a thoroughly Asiatic custom.
The idea seems to be derived from a kind of <i>a fortiori</i>
argument. If the feet, as the lowest member of the
body, are honoured, how much more is homage rendered
to the whole man. Hence children honour
their parents, not by kissing their faces, but by prostrating
themselves at their feet and touching them
reverentially. Another reason for venerating the feet
is well expressed in one of our hymns:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O let me see Thy foot-marks,</p>
<p class="t0">And in them plant my own;</p>
</div>
<p>and in Longfellow&rsquo;s</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Foot-prints on the sands of time;</p>
<p class="t0">Foot-prints which perhaps another,</p>
<p class="t">Sailing o&rsquo;er life&rsquo;s solemn main,</p>
<p class="t0">A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,</p>
<p class="t">Seeing may take life again.</p>
</div>
<p>This shows that even Europeans are familiar with
the idea. There is a Roman Catholic church at
Vienna which possesses a celebrated image of Christ
on the Cross. On one occasion I visited this church
and observed several worshippers kissing the feet of
the image, while others&mdash;too short in stature to reach
it with their lips&mdash;touched its feet with their fingers
and then kissed their fingers. A similar honour is paid
<span class="pb" id="Page_508">508</span>
to the images of St. Peter at Rome, and indeed to that
Apostle&rsquo;s living representatives. The alleged foot-prints
of Christ are not numerous, but they exist in certain
holy places<a class="fn" id="fr_266" href="#fn_266">[266]</a>.</p>
<p>Every sentiment in the East is exaggerated, and it
need not therefore be matter of wonder if a veneration
for foot-prints has led to an excessive multiplication
of these symbols, and to an excess of superstitious
worship paid to them by Hind&#363;s of various sects in
every part of India. No true Vaish&#7751;ava will leave
his house in the morning without marking his forehead
with the symbol of Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s feet. In travelling from
one place to another I often came across what appeared
to be an empty shrine, but on a close inspection I found
that it contained two foot-prints on a little raised altar
made of stone. These are called P&#257;duk&#257; &lsquo;shoes,&rsquo; but
are really the supposed impressions of the soles of the
feet of the person to whom the shrines are dedicated.
In 1876 I visited the celebrated Vish&#7751;u-pad temple at
Gay&#257;. Crowds were worshipping the foot-mark impressed
on the bare stone, but concealed by offerings,
and surrounded by a silver fence under a silver canopy
(see &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 309).</p>
<p>It is true that Buddhists never imitate the practice
<span class="pb" id="Page_509">509</span>
of the worshippers of Vish&#7751;u by marking their foreheads
with the supposed impressions of the Buddha&rsquo;s
feet, but they will nevertheless make long and toilsome
pilgrimages to bow down before what they believe to
be the impression of his foot on a rock.</p>
<p>The Jainas, who are the only Hind&#363; representatives
of the Buddhistic system left in India, are quite as
ardent foot-print worshippers. In 1884 I ascended
Mount P&#257;rasn&#257;th (P&#257;r&#7777;va-n&#257;th) in Bengal at the
same time with crowds of Jaina pilgrims who, like
myself, toiled up the hill to visit the numerous
Jaina temples scattered over the uneven surface at the
summit, some five thousand feet above the plain. Our
objects were very different. Theirs was the acquisition
of merit, mine was the acquirement of knowledge.
Lepers lined the rough pathway, and much additional
merit was held to accrue to the pilgrims by distributing
alms among them. I found that nearly every shrine
at the summit consisted of a little domed canopy of
marble, covering two foot-prints of some one of the
twenty-four Jaina saints (especially P&#257;r&#7777;va-n&#257;th) impressed
on a marble altar. The soles of the supposed
foot-prints were either white or black and marked with
small gilded circles.</p>
<p>Groups of worshippers bowed down before the shrines
and deposited offerings of money, rice, almonds, raisins,
and spices on the foot-marks. No sooner did they
quit one shrine for the next, than a troop of frolicking
monkeys promptly took their place and scampered off
with the edible portion of the objects offered.</p>
<p>It is impossible to state positively when either
<span class="pb" id="Page_510">510</span>
Buddhism or Jainism first introduced foot-print worship,
but the practice must have begun very early.</p>
<p>With regard to this point General Sir A. Cunningham,
in his account of the Bharhut St&#363;pa&mdash;a St&#363;pa
which dates from the second century <span class="small">B.C.</span>&mdash;says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Foot-prints of Buddha were most probably an object of reverence
from a very early period&mdash;certainly before the building of the Bharhut
St&#363;pa&mdash;as they are represented in two separate sculptures there. In
the first sculpture the foot-prints are placed on a throne or altar,
canopied by an umbrella, hung with garlands. A royal personage is
kneeling before the altar, and reverently touching the foot-prints with
his hands. The second example is in the bas-relief representing the
visit of Aj&#257;ta-&#7777;atru to Buddha. Here, as in all other Bharhut sculptures,
Buddha does not appear in person, his presence being marked
by his two foot-prints. The wheel symbol is duly marked on both
(p. 112, abridged).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The General justly remarks that perhaps the worship
of the Buddha&rsquo;s foot-prints may have sprung up in
imitation of the homage alleged to have been paid by
Mah&#257;-K&#257;&#7777;yapa and 500 monks to his feet, which, it
is said, were exposed to view when his body was
lying on the funeral pile. The legend states that
while the monks were in the act of bowing down in
adoration before the feet, the funeral pile ignited spontaneously.</p>
<p>On one of the gate-pillars of the ancient S&#257;&ntilde;ch&#299; St&#363;pa
there is a sculpture of a foot-print marked with the
wheel (&#262;akra, <a href="#Page_522">p. 522</a>) symbol, which the late Mr. Fergusson
ascribed to the early part of the first century of the
Christian era.</p>
<p>There are also sculptured representations of the
Buddha&rsquo;s foot-prints at Amar&#257;vat&#299;, supposed to date
<span class="pb" id="Page_511">511</span>
from the second or third century of the Christian era.
These representations are often carved on so-called altars
or else placed before altars.</p>
<p>But of all foot-prints, that on Adam&rsquo;s Peak (the
highest mountain in Ceylon, more than 7000 feet above
the sea), supposed to have been left by the Buddha
when he ascended thence to heaven, is the most celebrated.</p>
<p>According to F&#257;-hien (Legge, p. 102), when Buddha
was in Ceylon he planted one foot on the north of the
royal city and the other on Sumana-K&#363;&#7789;a (Adam&rsquo;s
Peak), fifteen yojanas, or about a hundred miles, distant.</p>
<p>This fancied impression of the Buddha&rsquo;s foot (believed
by Christians to be that of St. Thomas, by Muhammadans
to be that of Adam, and by Hind&#363;s to be that
of the god &#7776;iva) is merely a shapeless hollow in the
rock, five feet seven inches long by two feet seven
inches broad, which would give the Buddha a stature
of about thirty-five feet. It is said to have been discovered
by a hunter at the beginning of the century
before Christ, and, although very difficult of access, is
annually visited by about 100,000 Buddhist pilgrims.
Near it, on the summit of the mountain, is a small
temple dedicated to Saman (<a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>).</p>
<p>In a shrine near the tooth-temple at Kandy, I saw
a so-called facsimile of this foot-print. Those who are
physically incapable of toiling up the mountain to bow
down before the sacred impression on the rock, gain
nearly as much merit by worshipping its copy. The
shrine was filled with fragrant flowers recently deposited
on the facsimile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_512">512</div>
<p>Other foot-prints in various places throughout India,
Burma, Siam, Tibet, Mongolia, and China, are from
two to five feet long. A tradition is mentioned by
F&#257;-hien (Legge, 29) that, when Buddha visited Northern
India, he came to the country of Woo-chang or
Udy&#257;na, and there he left a print of his foot, which
appears long or short according to the ideas of the beholders.</p>
<p>Another legend states that Buddha left the print of
his left foot on Adam&rsquo;s Peak, and then, in one stride,
strode across to Siam, where he left the impression of
his right foot.</p>
<p>The Siamese hold their foot-print in as much reverence
as the Sinhalese hold theirs. It is called Phra
Bat, and, according to Mr. Alabaster, its appearance is
like that of the foot-print on Adam&rsquo;s Peak. Nothing
is to be seen but a hole in the rock, about five feet long
by two broad. A temple is built over it, and every
precaution taken to protect it from over-zealous worshippers.
Mr. Alabaster thus describes his visit to
this sacred spot:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The grating which usually covers the foot-print was removed to
enable us to see the bottom, but the temple was so dark that we could
not see much of it. We moved aside some of the offerings lying on
it, but could see nothing of the pattern except the five marks of the
toe-nails&mdash;five grooves in the rock&mdash;which some declare to have been
made with chisels. On inquiry we were told that the other marks
were long ago destroyed by an accidental fire. Likeness to a foot
there is none. Yet to this holy foot-print year after year crowds of
Siamese flock with varied offerings, and even the most enlightened
amongst them&mdash;the late King for instance&mdash;have observed and
encouraged the practice. (&lsquo;Wheel of the Law,&rsquo; p. 284, abridged.)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_513">513</div>
<p>The soles of the Buddha&rsquo;s feet are represented as
quite flat, and all the toes of equal length. Each sole
possesses, as we have seen (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>), one hundred and
eight auspicious marks (ma&#7749;gala-lakkha&#7751;a), and of these
the principal is generally the wheel (&#262;akra), while
around it are grouped representations of animals,
inhabitants of various worlds, and symbols of different
kinds. In all probability the idea is that all things
are subject to the Buddha or belong to him; they
are therefore metaphorically placed under his feet.
(Compare the metaphor in Psalm viii. 6-8.)</p>
<p>The one hundred and eight marks vary in various
specimens. A good typical example (brought from
Burma) of the impression of one foot may be seen in
the British Museum. The sole is divided into compartments,
each compartment containing a mark. There
are five conch-shells, one in each of the five toes, this
symbol being highly esteemed by Buddhists as well as
by Hind&#363;s.</p>
<p>Among the one hundred and eight auspicious marks
on the Siamese foot-print are the following:&mdash;A spear,
trident (tri-ratna), book, elephant-goad, Indra&rsquo;s elephant,
dragon (makara), ocean, golden ship, water with lotuses,
conch-shell, four-faced Brahm&#257;, umbrella, king of N&#257;gas,
king of horses, of tigers, of birds, sun, moon, ten
mountains, peacock, flag of victory, deer, fish, water-jar.
The wheel (&#262;akra) does not occur in Mr. Alabaster&rsquo;s
list (&lsquo;Wheel of the Law,&rsquo; p. 290), but the two feet of
the Amar&#257;vat&#299; St&#363;pa, described by Mr. Fergusson, have
a wheel in the centre of the soles. Above is the
Tri-ratna emblem with a Svastika symbol on each side.
<span class="pb" id="Page_514">514</span>
There are other Svastika marks, and others on the toes
(see <a href="#Page_523">p. 523</a>).</p>
<p>The Skanda-Pur&#257;&#7751;a and Bh&#257;gavata-Pur&#257;&#7751;a give
similar lists of marks on the sole of Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<h3><i>Sacred Trees.</i></h3>
<p>We now pass on to a brief consideration of sacred
trees. Most persons are aware that the homage offered
to trees and plants is not confined to Buddhism. It
existed very early in Br&#257;hmanism and is still common
everywhere throughout India (see my &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and
Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 330).</p>
<p>In point of fact various forms of tree-worship prevail
at the present moment in almost every part of the
world where superstition and ignorance are ruling
influences. Nor can we really condemn, as either
unnatural or unreasonable, the feeling of veneration
with which trees are generally regarded, bearing in
mind the grateful shade and shelter which they afford,
the beauty of their foliage, their importance as purifiers
of the atmosphere, and the hundreds of useful purposes
to which their wood, leaves, and fruit are applicable.
According to Dr. E. B. Tylor (&lsquo;Primitive Culture,&rsquo; ii.
223), the North American Indians of the Far West
often hang offerings on the trees to propitiate the spirits
and procure good weather and good hunting. He adds
that Mr. Darwin describes the South Americans as doing
much the same.</p>
<p>In Persia and other Eastern Countries trees may often
be met with, the branches of which have been recently
hung with offerings of cloth, rags, and even garments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_515">515</div>
<p>In India the notion of trees being inhabited by
deities or semi-divine beings or spirits is to this day
very common, and we have already noted (<a href="#Page_112">p. 112</a>) that
during the period of Gautama&rsquo;s Bodhi-sattvaship, in the
course of which he had to undergo countless births in
preparation for his Buddhahood, he was born forty-three
times as a tree-god.</p>
<p>In Siam, according to Mr. Alabaster, offerings are
commonly made in the present day to the spirits or
deities inhabiting trees. People hang various votive
objects on the branches, or place them on a stand or
altar beneath any particular tree whose deity they wish
to propitiate. Moreover they are very averse to the
cutting down of any trees of any kind, lest the tree-gods
should be angry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Some years ago,&rsquo; says Mr. Alabaster, &lsquo;when I employed my spare
energy in showing the Siamese how to make roads in the, till then,
roadless suburbs of Bangkok, I had to cut my lines through villages,
temple-groves, orchards, plantations, and patches of jungle. For
the &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; duty of cutting down the trees, a gang of the lowest
criminals was placed at my disposal.&rsquo; But he adds that the removal of
any specially holy building or tree was interdicted by the Government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already seen that, according to the theory of
later Buddhism, every Buddha is supposed to have his
own special tree under which he sat and meditated, and
in the end attained supreme knowledge (see <a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a>).
For example, there is the Pippala (also called A&#7777;vattha,
<i>Ficus Religiosa</i>) sacred fig-tree of Gautama Buddha, the
Va&#7789;a or Banyan-tree (<i>Ficus Indica</i>) of K&#257;&#7777;yapa Buddha,
the U&#7693;umbara (<i>Ficus Glomerata</i>) of Kanaka-muni; the
&#7776;ir&#299;sha (<i>Acacia Serisa</i>) of Kraku-&#262;&#263;handa; the &#7776;&#257;la
(<i>Shorea Robusta</i>) of Vi&#7777;va-bh&#363;; the Pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka (<i>White</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_516">516</span>
<i>Lotus</i>) of &#7776;ikhin<a class="fn" id="fr_267" href="#fn_267">[267]</a>; the P&#257;&#7789;ali (<i>Bignonia Suaveolens</i>) of
Vipa&#7777;yin.</p>
<p>These six Buddhas with Gautama are sometimes held
to be the seven principal Buddhas, and, according to
some authorities, the tree of the future Buddha
(Maitreya) will be the Iron-wood tree (Sideroxylon)<a class="fn" id="fr_268" href="#fn_268">[268]</a>.
Specimens of some of these trees are to be found
growing in the area of the Buddha-Gay&#257; temple, and
several are represented in the sculptures of the St&#363;pa of
Bharhut (of the second century <span class="small">B.C.</span>). On one of the
pillars of that St&#363;pa elephants are carved in the act of
worshipping both the P&#299;pal-tree and the Banyan-tree.
In fact it must be borne in mind that Gautama
Buddha is said to have meditated under both of these
trees, and is therefore connected with both (see <a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>).</p>
<p>It might have been expected, too, that the &#7776;&#257;l-tree
would have ranked next in sacredness to the P&#299;pal and
Banyan; for according to one legend, M&#257;y&#257; gave birth
to Gautama while standing under a &#7776;&#257;l-tree, and
according to another legend, Gautama died on a couch
placed between two &#7776;&#257;l-trees (pp. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>, <a href="#Page_50">50</a>). This tree,
however, appears to be more honoured in connexion
with the Buddha Vi&#7777;va-bh&#363; (<a href="#fn_54">p. 136, note 1</a>).</p>
<p>There are other trees which were held in veneration
by Indian Buddhists:&mdash;for example, the Mango (&#256;mra)
and the Jambu, and the A&#7777;oka. The first of these
appears frequently in sculptures, and is known by the
shape of its fruit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_517">517</div>
<p>Two other trees under which the Buddha is said to
have meditated after his attainment of Buddhahood&mdash;namely,
the Mu&#263;alinda-tree<a class="fn" id="fr_269" href="#fn_269">[269]</a> and the R&#257;j&#257;yatana-tree&mdash;are
not identified.</p>
<p>But among all trees revered by all Buddhists of
all nationalities, the A&#7777;vattha or Pippala (P&#299;pal), under
which Gautama achieved Buddhahood and perfect
knowledge, takes the precedence. In some Buddhist
countries the climate prevents its introduction, but if it
can by any means be made to grow, it is everywhere
planted close to Buddhist temples, monasteries and
D&#257;gabas, and in many cases is the product of a seed
brought from the supposed original tree at Buddha-Gay&#257;.</p>
<p>A tradition relates that Gautama during his lifetime
directed &#256;nanda to break off a branch from that
original tree and to plant it in the garden of the
Vih&#257;ra, or monastery, at &#7776;r&#257;vast&#299;&mdash;Gautama&rsquo;s favourite
place of residence&mdash;&lsquo;He who worships it,&rsquo; said Gautama,
&lsquo;will receive the same reward as if he worshipped me<a class="fn" id="fr_270" href="#fn_270">[270]</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is a mere legend resting on no historical basis;
but the tradition which makes Gautama choose a seat
under the sacred Pippala or A&#7777;vattha as the spot where
the first stirrings of a divine afflatus and the first
whisperings of divine communications&mdash;symbolized by
the mysterious quivering and rustling of its leaves&mdash;were
<span class="pb" id="Page_518">518</span>
likely to make themselves felt, points to a probable
fact&mdash;a fact quite in harmony with what we have
already noted in regard to his early Br&#257;hmanical
education and ideas. We read in the Ka&#7789;ha Upanishad
(VI. 1) that the root of the A&#7777;vattha-tree was identified
with the Supreme Being, Brahman. In a passage of
the Mu&#7751;&#7693;aka Upanishad (III. 1. 1) and in a Mantra of
the &#7770;ig-veda (I. 164. 20) the same idea is alluded to.
It is true that Gautama afterwards repudiated the
possibility of any divine inspiration coming from any
external source whatever, yet it is probable that when
he first seated himself under the sacred fig-tree, which
is even now regarded by the Hind&#363;s as a manifestation
of the god Brahm&#257;, he expected supernatural communications
of some kind<a class="fn" id="fr_271" href="#fn_271">[271]</a>.</p>
<p>The history of the original sacred Pippala (A&#7777;vattha)
tree, or as it is commonly called the Bodhi-tree (Bo-tree)
of Gautama Buddha at Buddha-Gay&#257;, has
already been sketched in a previous Lecture (see pp.
392-394).</p>
<p>Hiouen Thsang&rsquo;s description of the tree, as he saw it
in the seventh century, has also been given (see <a href="#Page_399">p. 399</a>).
F&#257;-hien, who saw it at Buddha-Gay&#257; in the fifth
century, calls it the Patra-tree. The following is an
abridgement of what he says about it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bodhi-sattva advanced to the Patra-tree, placed the Ku&#7777;a grass
at the foot of it, and sat down with his face to the east. Then King
<span class="pb" id="Page_519">519</span>
M&#257;ra sent three beautiful damsels to tempt him. The Bodhi-sattva
put his toes down to the ground, and the young maidens were changed
into old grandmothers. Buddha, after attaining perfect wisdom, contemplated
the tree for seven days (Legge, p. 88).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>F&#257;-hien also saw the offspring of the original Bodhi-tree
growing in Ceylon (Legge, p. 103).</p>
<p>It is recorded that soon after Mahinda, son of A&#7777;oka,
arrived in Ceylon (about 250 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) for the purpose of
propagating Buddhism, his sister, who had become
a Buddhist Nun, also arrived there, and brought with
her from King A&#7777;oka a branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree
of Buddha-Gay&#257;. This was planted at Anur&#257;dha-pura,
and the zealous Buddhists of Ceylon fully believe that
the identical tree exists there still.</p>
<p>An interesting account of the state of this tree or its
descendant, about thirty years ago, is given in Sir
Emerson Tennant&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ceylon&rsquo; (vol. ii. p. 613). I here give
an abridged extract:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bo-tree of Anur&#257;dha-pura is in all probability the oldest
historical tree in the world. Its conservancy has been an object of
solicitude to successive dynasties, and the story of its vicissitudes has
been preserved in a series of continuous chronicles.</p>
<p>It would almost seem to verify the prophecy pronounced when it
was planted, that it would flourish and be green for ever.</p>
<p>The degree of sanctity with which this extraordinary tree has been
invested by Buddhists, may be compared to the feeling of veneration
with which Christians regard the attested wood of the Cross.</p>
<p>The other Bo-trees which are found in the vicinity of every temple in
Ceylon are said to be all derived from the parent-tree at Anur&#257;dha-pura,
but they have been propagated by seeds; the priesthood
adhering in this respect to the precedent recorded in the Mah&#257;-va&#7753;&#7777;a
(when Mahinda himself, taking up a fruit as it fell, gave it to the king
to plant), and objecting religiously to lop it with any weapon.</p>
<p>In the fifth century F&#257;-hien found the Bo-tree at Anur&#257;dha-pura
<span class="pb" id="Page_520">520</span>
in vigorous health, and its guardians displaying towards it the same
vigilant tenderness which they exhibit at the present day.</p>
<p>The author of the Mah&#257;-va&#7753;&#7777;a, who wrote between the years 459
and 478 of our era, after relating the ceremonial which had been
observed nearly eight hundred years before, at the planting of the
venerated tree by Mahinda, concludes by saying:&mdash;&lsquo;Thus this
monarch of the forest, endowed with miraculous powers, has stood for
ages in La&#7749;k&#257;, promoting the spiritual welfare of its inhabitants and
the propagation of true religion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Buddhism became thoroughly mixed up with
Hind&#363;ism the Kalpa-tree or divine tree of Indra&rsquo;s paradise
was often introduced. It is supposed to have its
terrestrial counterpart in some sacred spots on earth, and
there to grant all desires, the worshipper having merely
to stretch out his hand and take the gifts suspended
from its branches<a class="fn" id="fr_272" href="#fn_272">[272]</a>. In one sculpture it is represented
pouring out coins on the ground. This kind of wishing-tree
is believed to present, among other things, any
food that its worshippers may ask for, and to present
it ready-cooked, if cooking is needed.</p>
<p>The miraculous tree which developed out of the
Buddha&rsquo;s tooth-cleaning twig, when thrown by him on
the ground, has been already described (see <a href="#Page_419">p. 419</a>, and
compare &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 337).</p>
<h3><i>Sacred Symbols.</i></h3>
<p>Some of the sacred objects already described may
be regarded as symbols. Of those which are more
<span class="pb" id="Page_521">521</span>
strictly symbols the <i>Tri-ratna</i> &lsquo;three-jewel&rsquo; emblem
comes first. It is three-pointed, and the three points
are simply emblematical of the Buddha, the Law, and
the Monastic Order. It is often used as an ornament.
Good examples may be seen in some of the Bharhut
sculptures (see Sir A. Cunningham&rsquo;s work). The central
point is often the least elevated.</p>
<p>The use of this triple symbol is another proof of
the connexion between Buddhism and Hind&#363;ism. Both
delight in triads and in symbolizing triads<a class="fn" id="fr_273" href="#fn_273">[273]</a>, but the
Buddhist &lsquo;three-jewel&rsquo; symbol should not be confused
with the Hind&#363; Tri-&#7777;&#363;la, which is &#7776;iva&rsquo;s trident used
as a weapon in his warfare with the demons. The
Tri-ratna is merely the analogue of the Tri-&#7777;&#363;la, as it
is also of the triple horizontal mark on the forehead
of &#7776;aivas, and of the Tri-pu&#7751;&#7693;ra or triple frontal mark
of the Tengalai sect of R&#257;m&#257;nuja Vaish&#7751;avas. The
two outer marks of the latter stand for Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s two
feet and the middle for his consort Lakshm&#299;<a class="fn" id="fr_274" href="#fn_274">[274]</a>.</p>
<p>Sir A. Cunningham was the first to show that the
three fetish-like figures of Jagann&#257;th (K&#7771;ish&#7751;a) and his
sister and brother, at Pur&#299; in Orissa, were derived from
three of the combined emblems of the Buddhist Tri-ratna
(compare <a href="#Page_166">p. 166</a> of this volume).</p>
<p>Next to the Tri-ratna comes the <i>&#262;akra</i> or wheel.
This symbolizes the Buddhist doctrine that the origin
<span class="pb" id="Page_522">522</span>
of life and of the universe (<a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>) are unknowable&mdash;the
doctrine of a circle of causes and effects without
beginning and without end. The wheel also typifies
the rolling of this doctrine over the whole surface
of the world (pp. <a href="#Page_410">410</a>, <a href="#Page_423">423</a>). It is perhaps one of the
most important symbols of Buddhist philosophy. It is
often represented as either supporting the Tri-ratna or
supported by it, or the latter may be inserted in it.</p>
<p>Observe that the &#262;akra or wheel is equally a Vaish&#7751;ava
symbol, but in the hand of Vish&#7751;u or of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a
it is a circular weapon, hurled at a demon-foe.</p>
<p>Another symbol is the <i>Lotus-flower</i>. Its constant use
as an emblem, seems to result from the wheel-like
form of the flower&mdash;the petals taking the place of
spokes, and thus typifying the doctrine of perpetual
cycles of existence&mdash;or from the perfection typified by
the regularity of these petals, or from the idea that its
expanded flower, reposing on a calm mirror-like lake,
is a fit emblem of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a.</p>
<p>The Wheel, the Tri-ratna, and the Lotus are so
important, as symbols of Buddhism, that they are
combined in the vignette on the title-page of this
volume.</p>
<p>Another symbol is the <i>Svastika</i> mark, consisting of
two lines crossing each other, the termination of each
arm of the cross being usually bent round in the
same direction<a class="fn" id="fr_275" href="#fn_275">[275]</a>. Much controversy has been devoted
to the origin and meaning of this symbol, which simply
symbolizes good luck, and equally belongs to Hind&#363;ism.
<span class="pb" id="Page_523">523</span>
Long ago I propounded a theory that it might represent
the four arms of Lakshm&#299;. I now think it a mere
curtailed form of the Wheel, consisting of four spokes
with a portion of the periphery of the circle. In my
opinion, the four spokes may represent the four groups
of worlds (i. e. the lower worlds and three groups of
heavens, <a href="#Page_213">p. 213</a>) circling in an eternal cycle. Sir
A. Cunningham considers this symbol to be a monogram
or interlacing of the letters of the auspicious words <i>su
asti</i> (<i>svasti</i>) in the A&#7777;oka characters.</p>
<p>Another symbol is the <i>Throne</i> or seat of Buddha&mdash;a
favourite emblem in many sculptures. In Cunningham&rsquo;s
&lsquo;St&#363;pa of Bharhut&rsquo; the throne of each Buddha is often
represented under his Bodhi-tree (but without any
image), and the thrones of the last four Buddhas are
joined together in a single bas-relief. Sometimes the
throne is covered by an umbrella with garlands, or
the Buddha&rsquo;s bowl may rest on it. Sometimes two
foot-prints are on a foot-stool under the throne.</p>
<p>Another venerated symbol is the <i>St&#363;pa</i> (see <a href="#Page_505">p. 505</a>).
It is often an object of adoration in itself.</p>
<p>I need scarcely revert to the <i>Umbrella</i> symbol (see
<a href="#Page_393">p. 393</a>). In Eastern countries it typifies supremacy. If a
king is present no one else ought to carry an umbrella.</p>
<p>The <i>&#7776;a&#7749;kha</i> or <i>Conch-shell</i> is a very auspicious symbol,
especially if the convolutions turn to the right in the
Nandy-&#257;varta form, as on the Buddha&rsquo;s foot (see <a href="#Page_513">p. 513</a>).</p>
<p>The Tibetan symbol of the &lsquo;<i>Flying horse</i>&rsquo; (Lung-ta)&mdash;able
to transport a man round the world in one day&mdash;has
been mentioned before; also the <i>Norbu</i> gem
(see pp. <a href="#Page_381">381</a>, <a href="#Page_528">528</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_524">524</div>
<h3><i>Sacred Animals.</i></h3>
<p>It may be truly said that all animals are more or
less venerated&mdash;though not actually worshipped&mdash;under
the Buddhist system. How can it be otherwise when
every Buddhist believes that the Buddha himself was
incarnated in various animals during the period of his
Bodhi-sattvaship (see <a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>)?</p>
<p>In the same way the Hind&#363;s believe that the god
Vish&#7751;u was incarnated in animals, such as a fish, a
tortoise, and a boar.</p>
<p>Buddhism in this as in other respects is like Br&#257;hmanism
and Hind&#363;ism. The feeling of reverence for
animals rests on the doctrine of metempsychosis. It
is difficult for either a Hind&#363; or a Buddhist to draw
a line of demarcation between gods, men, and animals,
when the same living being may exist as a god, a man,
or an animal. It is on this account that in India
animals appear to live on terms of the greatest friendship
and mutual confidence with human beings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everywhere in India animals dispute possession of the earth with
man. Birds build their nests and lay their eggs in the fields,
untroubled by fears or misgivings, before the very eyes of every
passer-by, and within the reach of every village school-boy. Animals
rove over the soil as if they were the landlords. Bulls walk about
independently in the streets, and jostle you on the pavements; monkeys
domesticate themselves jauntily on the roof of your house; parrots
peer inquisitively from the eaves of your bedroom into the mysteries
of your toilet; crows make themselves at home on your window-sill,
and carry off impudently any portable article of jewellery that takes
their fancy on your dressing-table; sparrows hop about impertinently
and take the bread off your table-cloth; a solitary mongoose emerges
every morning from a hole in your verandah, and expects a share in
your breakfast; swarms of insects claim a portion of your mid-day
<span class="pb" id="Page_525">525</span>
meal, and levy a tax on the choicest delicacies at your dinner table;
bats career triumphantly about your head as you light yourself to
your bedroom; and at certain seasons snakes domicile themselves
unpleasantly in the folds of your cast-off garments. (Quoted from my
&lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism.&rsquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most sacred animal in the estimation
of all Buddhists is the elephant. This will be easily
understood by recalling what has been said in a previous
Lecture (see pp. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>, <a href="#Page_24">24</a>). In one of the Bharhut
sculptures the white elephant is seen descending to
enter the side of Gautama&rsquo;s mother M&#257;y&#257; (&lsquo;St&#363;pa of
Bharhut,&rsquo; <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>). The elephant, says Sir A. Cunningham,
is a favourite subject for delineation. It is represented
in almost every possible position, as standing,
walking, running, sitting down, eating, drinking, throwing
water over its own back, and lastly, kneeling down
in reverence before the holy Bodhi-tree.</p>
<p>Probably the next sacred animal to the elephant
is the deer. The Buddha was born eleven times as a
deer (<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>), and he delivered his first sermon in a
deer-park (<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>). The &lsquo;goose&rsquo; (Ha&#7753;sa, sometimes called
&lsquo;a duck&rsquo; or &lsquo;a swan&rsquo;) is also very sacred. With regard
to other animals, Sir A. Cunningham remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The animals represented in the Bharhut sculptures are of two
classes, the natural and the fabulous. The latter, however, are
limited to three varieties, an elephant with a fish-tail, a crocodile with
a fish-tail, and a winged horse; while the former comprises no less
than fourteen quadrupeds, six birds, one snake, one fish, one insect,
one crocodile, two tortoises, one lizard, and one frog. The quadrupeds
include the lion, elephant, horse, rhinoceros, wild boar, bull, deer,
wolf, monkey, cat, dog, sheep, hare, and squirrel. The birds comprise
the cock, parrot, peacock, goose, wild duck, and quail. The snakes
and fishes appear to be of only one kind. The solitary insect is
a flesh-fly (<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_526">526</div>
<p>In Burma people feed sacred fish, and save their
lives in seasons when they would perish through the
drying up of rivers and ponds (see <a href="#Page_364">p. 364</a>).</p>
<p>Dr. Eitel, in his Lectures (p. 136), points out that
even pigs are held sacred, though not worshipped, by
Northern Buddhists. We must not forget that the
Buddha in two of his births was a pig (<a href="#Page_112">p. 112</a>), that he
died of eating pork, and that in sculptures of the
T&#257;ntrik goddess Vajra-v&#257;r&#257;h&#299;&mdash;adopted by Northern
Buddhists&mdash;a row of seven pigs is carved underneath
her three-headed figure, one head being that of a pig.</p>
<h3><i>Miscellaneous Objects.</i></h3>
<p>Among these may be reckoned <i>bells</i> of various kinds.
The prayer-bells common in Tibet, which are held in
the hand and used during the chanting of prayers,
have been already described (<a href="#Page_323">p. 323</a>).</p>
<p>In Burma bells abound everywhere. They are of
all sizes, and often of immense weight, but are not
used in the same way as in Tibet. Nor are they ever
rung in peals or with a clapper. Their use is not to
call people to religious services. It is no part of the
business of monks or priests to summon the laity
to any service. Every man worships on his own
account, and for himself, and by himself, and no so-called
priest reminds him of his religious duties, or
is responsible if he neglects them.</p>
<p>The real use of bells in Burmese temples is to
draw the attention of the deities and spirits (Naths)
to the act of worship, and so secure the due registering
of prayer-merit. When a man has finished his repetitions,
he strikes the bell with a piece of wood or
<span class="pb" id="Page_527">527</span>
other sacred implement lying near, and the more noise
he makes the better. Mr. Scott informs us that every
large pagoda has dozens of bells of all sizes, hanging
outside, and one or two inside the central shrine. They
are constantly dedicated by religious people, and thus
multiplied <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>
<p>The form of dedication is inscribed on every bell,
and is in the P&#257;li language, though instances of the
vernacular occur.</p>
<p>The following is a portion of a remarkable inscription
in the vernacular (Shway Yoe, i. 243, abridged):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This bell was moulded with great care and much expense, and is
humbly offered by Moung San Yah and his wife, who seek refuge in
the boundless mercy of the pitiful Buddha, in the majesty of the
eternal law, and in the examples of the venerable assembly. They
humbly strive to gain merit for themselves. May the good Naths
look smilingly on them. May the Naths who dwell in the air and the
earth defend their two fat bullocks&mdash;which plough the fields&mdash;from
evil creatures. May the guardian Naths of the house and of the city
keep Chit Oo, their son, and little Mah Mee, their darling daughter,
from harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The weight of the bell is generally added to the
dedication.</p>
<p>There is a fine Burmese bell in the Indian section
of the South Kensington Museum. It has a long P&#257;li
inscription, a portion of the translation of which I
here give:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Without charity you cannot attain to Nirv&#257;&#7751;a&rsquo;&mdash;so it is written
in the P&#257;li Texts.</p>
<p>I, the giver of this bell, was staying in the sweet-smelling town of
Ma-oo&mdash;of which I collect the taxes for the king&mdash;and with me was
my wife&mdash;my life&rsquo;s breath&mdash;like to the pollen of a lily, from whom
I will not be separated in all the existences which are to come, and
out of which we hope soon to escape. We adore Buddha, that we may
embark in the golden raft of the Noble Path, which will lead us to
<span class="pb" id="Page_528">528</span>
the final plunge into Nirv&#257;&#7751;a. We two, brother and sister (that is,
husband and wife), have given this bell as an offering. The exact
weight of the bell is 2500 kyats. We took our own weight in gold
and silver and bright copper and other metal, and mixed them well
together, in the year 1209 (1847 <span class="small">A.D.</span>).</p>
<p>Now I will record all the alms I gave and what I erected within the
sacred enclosure. I gave a sacred flag-staff (see <a href="#Page_380">p. 380</a> of these Lectures),
the price of which, with all expenses in putting up, was 500
rupees. At the foot of it I built four small pagodas. Outside I built
a monastery and a rest-house. Such are all the offerings. May I be
freed from the Four states of Punishment, from the Three Great
Calamities (war, famine, and plague), from the Eight Evil Places, from
the Five Enemies, from unfortunate times and seasons, and from bad
people. May I escape all these when I die.</p>
<p>All the merits I have gained, may they be shared with my parents,
teachers, and all my relations; with kings, queens, nobles, and all
people in the thirty-one places of habitation throughout the universe.
(See <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a> of these Lectures.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the head of miscellaneous objects, we may
note the seven precious minerals or substances to which
allusion has frequently been made. They are gold,
silver, pearl, sapphire or ruby, cat&rsquo;s eye, diamond, and
coral (Childers); but they vary, and some authorities
substitute lapis lazuli for pearl. In Hind&#363;ism there
are nine precious substances (nava-ratna).</p>
<p>We may also enumerate here the seven treasures
belonging to every universal monarch. These are:&mdash;1.
a wheel which, being set in motion by the monarch,
rolls before him to establish the Law in his dominions;
2. an elephant; 3. a flying horse (see <a href="#Page_523">p. 523</a>); 4. a
jewel which on the darkest night illuminates the earth
for seven miles round (<a href="#Page_381">p. 381</a>); 5. a good queen or
wife; 6. a good minister or servant, who has the power
of discovering hidden treasures; 7. a good general
(compare Alabaster&rsquo;s &lsquo;Wheel of the Law,&rsquo; p. 81).</p>

<h2 id="c23"><i>Supplementary Remarks on the Connexion of Buddhism with Jainism<a class="fn" id="fr_276" href="#fn_276">[276]</a>.</i></h2>
<p>Having during the progress of the foregoing Lectures,
incidentally mentioned the subject of Jainism,
I ought not to conclude them without explaining some
of the chief points of difference between the system
of the Jainas (conveniently contracted into Jains) and
that of the Buddhists. The Jains in India, according
to their own reckoning, number 1,222,000; but this is
incorrect, for by the last Census they only number half
a million. A great authority (Sir William Wilson
Hunter) confirms this. (See his &lsquo;Gazetteer&rsquo; and &lsquo;Indian
Empire.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>Most scholars in the present day are of opinion that
the Jaina Teacher Vardham&#257;na Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra (N&#257;taputta)
and Gautama Buddha were contemporaries, and that
Jains were an independent sceptical sect, probably a
little antecedent to the Buddhists, and were their rivals.
At any rate it seems certain that the Niga&#7751;&#7789;has<a class="fn" id="fr_277" href="#fn_277">[277]</a> or
<span class="pb" id="Page_530">530</span>
Dig-ambara Jains, that is, a sect of naked ascetics,
existed before the Buddha&rsquo;s time, and that the Tripi&#7789;aka
alludes to them.</p>
<p>Probably Vardham&#257;na Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra (usually called
Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra) was merely a reformer of a system previously
founded by a teacher named P&#257;r&#7777;va-n&#257;tha.
Not much is known of the latter, though he is greatly
honoured by the Jains. His images are &lsquo;serpent-canopied&rsquo;
like those of Buddha (<a href="#Page_480">p. 480</a>). His pupils
are called P&#257;s&#257;va&#263;&#263;ijja (for P&#257;r&#7777;v&#257;paty&#299;ya, &lsquo;belonging
to the descendants of P&#257;r&#7777;va&rsquo;). They were only bound
by four vows, whereas Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra&rsquo;s teaching imposed
five vows.</p>
<p>We have seen that Gautama Buddha, in the fifth
century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, came to the conclusion that bodily austerities
were useless as a means of obtaining liberation.
His main idea seems to have been that liberation from
the painful cycle of continued re-births, that is, from
Sa&#7747;s&#257;ra, was to be obtained by means of knowledge
(Bodhi), evolved out of the inner consciousness through
meditation (dhy&#257;na) and intuition; whereas, in contradistinction
to this Buddhist idea, the main idea of the
Jain teacher Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra seems to have been that liberation
was to be obtained through subjugation of the
passions and through mortification of the body (tapas).
The term Jina, &lsquo;conqueror,&rsquo; is used in both systems,
but Gautama Buddha was a Jina or conqueror through
profound abstract meditation, whereas Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra was a
Jina through severe bodily austerity.</p>
<p>In fact, the Jains, like all other ascetics, were
impressed with the idea that it was necessary to
<span class="pb" id="Page_531">531</span>
maintain a defensive warfare against the assault of
evil passions, by keeping under the body and subduing
it. They had also a notion that a sense of shame
implied sin, so that if there were no sin in the world
there would be no shame. Hence they argued rather
illogically that to get rid of clothes was to get rid of
sin; and every ascetic who aimed at sinlessness was
enjoined to walk about naked, with the air or sky (Dig)
as his sole covering (Dig-ambara).</p>
<p>In the Kalpa-s&#363;tra of the Jains we read that Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra
himself began his career by wearing clothes for one
year and one month, and after that he walked about
naked. Now Gautama Buddha was an opponent of
Jain asceticism, and it seems to me probable that one of
the chief points on which he laid stress was that of
decent clothing. In the Dhamma-pada (141) occurs the
sentiment that &lsquo;Nakedness cannot purify a mortal who
has not overcome desires.&rsquo; And again, in the Sekhiy&#257;
Dhamm&#257; we have &lsquo;properly clad&rsquo; &lsquo;must a monk
itinerate.&rsquo; (See <a href="#Page_473">p. 473</a> of these Lectures.)</p>
<p>It is recorded in the Vinaya (Mah&#257;-vagga I. 6. 7-9)
that Upaka, a man of the &#256;j&#299;vaka sect of naked ascetics,
founded by Gos&#257;la (said to have been a pupil of Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra),
met the Buddha just after his enlightenment, and
noticing his bright countenance, asked him who had
been his teacher? He replied, &lsquo;Having gained all
knowledge, I am myself the highest teacher.&rsquo; Thereupon
the naked ascetic shook his head and went
another road.</p>
<p>Clearly these naked Niga&#7751;&#7789;has, disciples of the Jain
Teacher Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra, were no friends of the Buddha. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_532">532</span>
seems to me even possible that Gautama&rsquo;s great rival,
Deva-datta (see pp. <a href="#Page_405">405</a>, <a href="#Page_406">406</a>), may have belonged to a
Dig-ambara sect who opposed the Buddha on questions
of stricter asceticism, especially in the matter of
clothing; for in ancient sculptures Deva-datta is generally
represented naked or nearly so, and is usually in
close proximity to his cousin Gautama Buddha, who,
in marked contrast to the other, is always clothed.
Evidently the question of dress was a crucial one, and
in process of time a party seems to have arisen, even
among the Dig-ambara Jains, opposed to strict asceticism
in this particular.</p>
<p>This party ultimately formed themselves into a
separate sect, calling themselves &#7776;vet&#257;mbaras, that is,
&lsquo;clothed in white garments.&rsquo; It is well known that in
early Buddhism two similar parties arose, the strict and
the lax. But the two Buddhist parties were ultimately
reunited. The second council is supposed to have
settled the controversy.</p>
<p>Dr. Jacobi has shown that the separation of the two
Jain sects must have taken place (according to the traditions
of both parties) some time before the first century
of our era.</p>
<p>It appears probable that the strict Dig-ambaras
preceded the more lax &#7776;vet&#257;mbaras, though each
sect claims to be the oldest. The two Jain sects
have remained separate to the present day, though
in all essential points of doctrine and discipline they
agree.</p>
<p>When I was last in India, in 1884, I ascended the
two hills, P&#257;rasn&#257;th (for P&#257;r&#7777;va-n&#257;th) and &#256;b&#363;&mdash;both
<span class="pb" id="Page_533">533</span>
of them most sacred places in the estimation of the
Jains, and covered with their temples. My ascent of
the former has been already described (<a href="#Page_509">p. 509</a>). I also
visited Delhi, Jaypur, &#256;jmere, and some other chief Jain
stations. Jaypur is the stronghold of the Dig-ambara
Jains, and two intelligent Dig-ambara Pa&#7751;&#7693;its, named
Pha&#7789;e L&#257;l and Syoj&#299; L&#257;l, visited me there. We
conversed for a long time in Sansk&#7771;it, and I asked them
many questions about their religion, and the points in
which they differed from the &#7776;vet&#257;mbara sect.</p>
<p>Three chief differences were stated to be: First, the
&#7776;vet&#257;mbaras object to entirely nude images of any of
the twenty-four Jinas or T&#299;rtha&#7747;-karas accepted by both
sects. Hence all &#7776;vet&#257;mbara statues ought to have
some appearance of a line round the middle of the
body, representing a strip of cloth. In one respect the
images of the Jinas differ from those of the Buddhas.
They have a jewel-like mark on the breast. This is
especially conspicuous in P&#257;r&#7777;va-n&#257;th. They are also
of different colours, and have symbols (generally animals,
such as a deer, tortoise, pig) connected with them.</p>
<p>Secondly, the &#7776;vet&#257;mbaras admit women into their
order of ascetics just as Buddhists have their Bhikkhun&#299;s,
or nuns; whereas the Dig-ambaras, for obvious
reasons, do not admit women.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the &#7776;vet&#257;mbaras have distinct sacred books
of their own, which they call A&#7749;gas, &lsquo;limbs of the Law,&rsquo;
eleven in number, besides others, making 45 &#256;gamas,
11 A&#7749;gas, 12 Up&#257;&#7749;gas, 10 P&#257;innas (Prak&#299;r&#7751;aka), 4 M&#363;las,
6 &#262;hedas, 1 Anuyoga-dv&#257;ra, and 1 Nandi. Dr. B&uuml;hler
places the composition of the A&#7749;gas in the third century
<span class="pb" id="Page_534">534</span>
B.C. Dr. Jacobi places them at the end of the fourth or
beginning of the third century. They are written in
Jain Pr&#257;k&#7771;it (sometimes called Ardha-M&#257;gadh&#299;, a later
form than P&#257;li), with Sansk&#7771;it commentaries. The Dig-ambaras
substitute, for the A&#7749;gas, later works, also
written in more modern Pr&#257;k&#7771;it (probably in the fifth
or sixth century after Christ), and maintain that the
&#7776;vet&#257;mbara Canon is spurious. Both sects have valuable
Sansk&#7771;it works in their sacred literature.</p>
<p>I now add a few characteristics of both sects of Jains
as distinguishing them from Buddhists.</p>
<p>I need scarcely notice the fact that the Jains of the
present day keep up Caste. The two Jain Pa&#7751;&#7693;its who
came to me at Jaypur were Br&#257;hmans, and wore the
Br&#257;hmanical thread. I believe this to be a mere modern
innovation, which does not properly belong to the Jain
system.</p>
<p>More important are the following points:&mdash;The Jain
saints, or prophets, are called by a peculiar name
T&#299;rtha&#7747;-kara, &lsquo;ford-makers,&rsquo; i. e. making a ford across
the troubled river of constant births or transmigrations
(Sa&#7747;s&#257;ra) to the Elysium of Nirv&#257;&#7751;a; whereas the
name T&#299;rtha&#7747;-kara with the Buddhists means a
&lsquo;heretical teacher.&rsquo; Then there are twenty-four Jain
T&#299;rtha&#7747;-karas, whereas there are twenty-five Buddhas.
Of the twenty-four Jain saints, the twenty-third and
twenty-fourth&mdash;P&#257;r&#7777;va-n&#257;th (pp. <a href="#Page_509">509</a>, <a href="#Page_529">529</a>) and Mah&#257;-v&#299;ra&mdash;are
the only historical personages. The others,
beginning with &#7770;ishabha, are mythical.</p>
<p>Next, the Jains have no St&#363;pas or D&#257;gabas (<a href="#Page_504">p. 504</a>)
for preserving the relics of their saints.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_535">535</div>
<p>Still more important is the point that the Jains
believe in separate individual souls (J&#299;va), whereas the
Buddhists deny the existence of souls. Souls, according
to the Jains, may exist in stocks, stones, lumps of earth,
drops of water, particles of fire. In Buddhism there
is, as we have seen, no true metempsychosis, but rather
a connected series of metamorphoses, and this stops
at animals; whereas the metempsychosis of Jainism
extends to inorganic matter.</p>
<p>With regard to the moral code two or three points
may be noticed. The Jaina &lsquo;three jewels&rsquo; are Right-belief,
Right-knowledge, and Right-conduct, whereas
the Buddhist Tri-ratna consists in the well-known
Triad&mdash;the Buddha, the Law, and the Monkhood.</p>
<p>Then as to the five chief Moral Prohibitions&mdash;the
fifth with Jains is: &lsquo;have no worldly attachments;&rsquo;
whereas with Buddhists it is: &lsquo;drink no strong drink.&rsquo;
I believe the Buddhists to have been the first to
introduce total abstinence from strong drinks into
India. The Jains, too, lay even more stress than the
Buddhists on the first prohibition:&mdash;Kill no living creature.
They strain water before drinking, sweep the
ground with a silken brush before sitting down on it,
never eat in the dark, often wear muslin before their
mouths to catch minute insects, and even object to
eating fruits containing seed.</p>
<p>Another interesting difference is that Jainism makes
Dharma and Adharma, good and evil, or rather merit
and demerit, two out of its six real substances&mdash;its
fundamental and eternal principles (Astik&#257;ya)&mdash;the
other four being matter (pudgala), soul (j&#299;va), space and
<span class="pb" id="Page_536">536</span>
time. The Jains reject the Buddhist theory of the five
Skandhas (see <a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>).</p>
<p>Lastly, the prayer-formula of the Jains differs from
the well-known &lsquo;three-refuge&rsquo; formula of the Buddhists
(&lsquo;I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Law, and the
order of Monks&rsquo;) thus: &lsquo;Reverence to the Arhats, to the
Siddhas, to the A&#263;&#257;ryas, to the Up&#257;dhy&#257;yas, to all the
S&#257;dhus&rsquo; (Namo Arihant&#257;&#7751;a&#7747; namo Siddh&#257;&#7751;a&#7747; namo
Ayariy&#257;&#7751;a&#7747; namo Uvajjh&#257;y&#257;&#7751;a&#7747; namo loe sabba-s&#257;h&#363;&#7751;a&#7747;).</p>
<p>Time will not permit me to notice minor differences,
such as the Jain rule that the hair should be painfully
torn off, instead of cut off, etc.</p>
<p>Certainly Jainism, when viewed from the stand-point
of Christianity, is even a colder system than Buddhism,
and has even less claim to be called a religion. Yet no
system can show a greater number of temples. Every
Jain who is noted for his piety builds a small temple.
He never repairs the temples of others. At P&#257;lit&#257;na in
K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r, there is a whole city of Jain temples. Nor
is it at all necessary that every temple built to hold a
Jain saint should possess either priests or worshippers.
What is aimed at is the acquisition of merit by the
performance of pious acts.</p>
<p>I must conclude by expressing my opinion that
Indian Jainism is gradually drifting back into the current
of Br&#257;hmanism, which everywhere surrounds it
and attracts it. Jainism, like Buddhism, came out from
Br&#257;hmanism, and into Br&#257;hmanism it is destined to
return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_537">537</div>
<h2 id="c24">LECTURE XVIII.
<br /><i>Buddhism contrasted with Christianity.</i></h2>
<p>In the previous Lectures I have incidentally contrasted
the principal doctrines of Buddhism with those
of Christianity.</p>
<p>It will be my aim in this concluding Lecture to
draw attention more directly and more in detail to
the main points of divergence between two systems,
which in their moral teaching have so many points of
contact, that a superficial study of either is apt to lead
to very confused ideas in regard to their comparative
excellence and their resemblance to each other.</p>
<p>And first of all I must remind those who heard my
earlier Lectures of the grand fundamental distinction
which they were intended to establish&mdash;namely, that
Christianity is a religion, whereas Buddhism, at least
in its earliest and truest form, is no religion at all,
but a mere system of morality and philosophy founded
on a pessimistic theory of life.</p>
<p>Here, however, it may be objected that, before we
exclude Buddhism from all title to be called a religion,
we ought to define what we mean by the term &lsquo;religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course, it will be generally acknowledged that
mere morality need not imply religion, though&mdash;taking
<span class="pb" id="Page_538">538</span>
the converse&mdash;it is most undeniably true that religion
must of necessity imply morality.</p>
<p>Unquestionably there have been great philosophers
in ancient times who have lived strictly moral lives
without acknowledging any religious creed at all.
Many excellent men, too, exist among us in the present
day, who resent being called irreligious, and yet
hold no definite religious doctrines, and decline to accept
any system which commits them to absolute belief
in anything except an eternal Energy or Force.</p>
<p>Clearly the definition of the word &lsquo;religion&rsquo; is beset
with difficulties, and its etymology is too uncertain
to help us in explaining it<a class="fn" id="fr_278" href="#fn_278">[278]</a>. We shall, however, be
justified if we affirm that every system claiming to
be a religion in the proper sense of the word must
postulate the eternal existence of one living and true
God of infinite power, wisdom, and love, the Creator,
Designer, and Preserver of all things visible and invisible.</p>
<p>It must also take for granted the immortality of
man&rsquo;s soul or spirit, and the reality of a future state
and of an unseen world. It must also postulate
in man an innate sense of dependence on a personal
God&mdash;a sense of reverence and love for Him, springing
from a belief in His justice, holiness, wisdom, power,
and love, and intensified by a deep consciousness of
weakness, and a yearning to be delivered from the
presence, tyranny, and penalty of sin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_539">539</div>
<p>Then, starting from these assumptions, it must
satisfy four requisites.</p>
<p>First, it must reveal the Creator in His nature and
attributes to His creature, man.</p>
<p>Secondly, it must reveal man to himself. It must
impart to him a knowledge of his own nature and
history&mdash;what he is; why he was created; whither he
is tending; and whether he is at present in a state of
decadence downwards from a higher condition, or of
development upwards from a lower.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it must reveal some method by which the
finite creature may communicate with the infinite
Creator&mdash;some plan by which he may gain access to
Him and become united with Him, and be saved by
Him from the consequences of his own sinful acts.</p>
<p>Fourthly, such a system must prove its title to be
called a religion by its regenerating effect on man&rsquo;s
nature; by its influence on his thoughts, desires, passions,
and feelings; by its power of subduing all his evil
tendencies; by its ability to transform his character
and assimilate him to the God it reveals.</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that tried by such a criterion as
this, early Buddhism could not claim to be a religion.
It failed to satisfy these conditions. It refused to
admit the existence of a personal Creator, or of man&rsquo;s
dependence on a higher Power. It denied any eternal
soul or Ego in man. It acknowledged no external,
supernatural revelation. It had no priesthood&mdash;no real
clergy; no real prayer; no real worship. It had no
true idea of sin, or of the need of pardon (<a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>), and
it condemned man to suffer the consequences of his own
<span class="pb" id="Page_540">540</span>
sinful acts without hope of help from any Saviour or
Redeemer, and indeed from any being but himself.</p>
<p>The late Bishop of Calcutta once said to me, that
being in an outlying part of his diocese, where
Buddhism prevailed, he asked an apparently pious
Buddhist, whom he happened to observe praying in a
temple, what he had just been praying for? He replied,
&lsquo;I have been praying for nothing.&rsquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; urged the
Bishop, &lsquo;to whom have you been praying?&rsquo; The man
answered, &lsquo;I have been praying to nobody.&rsquo; &lsquo;What!&rsquo;
said the astonished Bishop, &lsquo;praying for nothing to
nobody?&rsquo; And no doubt this anecdote gives an accurate
idea of the so-called prayer of a true Buddhist.
This man had not really been praying for anything.
He had been merely making use of some form of words
to which an efficacy, like that of sowing fruitful seed
in a field, was supposed to belong. He had not been
praying in any Christian sense.</p>
<p>Here, however, an objector might remind me that
according to my own showing, various developments
of Buddhism modified and even contradicted the
original creed, and that what has been here said about
prayer, is only strictly applicable to early Buddhism
as originally taught in the most ancient texts.</p>
<p>I grant this&mdash;I grant that expressions of reverence
for the Buddha, the Law, and the Monkhood, developed
into expressions of wants and needs, and that these
expressions, gradually led on to the offering of actual
prayers to deified Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas.</p>
<p>I admit that we ought to judge of Buddhism as
a whole. We ought to give full consideration to its
<span class="pb" id="Page_541">541</span>
later developments, and the gradual sliding of its
atheism and agnosticism into theism and polytheism.
We are bound to acknowledge that Buddhism, as it
extended to other countries, <i>did</i> acquire the character
of a theistic religious system, which, though false, had
in it some points of contact with Christianity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, admitting all this, and taking into
account all that can be said in favour of Buddhism
as a religious system, it will be easy to show how
impossible it is to bridge over the yawning chasm
which separates it from the true religion.</p>
<p>It is, indeed, one of the strange phenomena of the
present day, that even educated people who call themselves
Christians, are apt to fall into raptures over the
precepts of Buddhism<a class="fn" id="fr_279" href="#fn_279">[279]</a>, attracted by the bright gems
which its admirers delight in culling out of its moral
code, and in displaying ostentatiously, while keeping
out of sight all its dark spots, all its trivialities and
senseless repetitions<a class="fn" id="fr_280" href="#fn_280">[280]</a>;
not to speak of all those evidences
<span class="pb" id="Page_542">542</span>
of deep corruption beneath a whited surface, all
<span class="pb" id="Page_543">543</span>
those significant precepts and prohibitions in its books
of discipline, which indeed no Christian could soil his
lips by uttering<a class="fn" id="fr_281" href="#fn_281">[281]</a>.</p>
<p>It has even been asserted that much of the teaching
in the Sermon on the Mount, and in other parts of
the Gospel narratives, is based on previously current
moral teaching, which Buddhism was the first to introduce
to the world, 500 years before Christ<a class="fn" id="fr_282" href="#fn_282">[282]</a>. But this
is not all. The admirers of Buddhism maintain that
the Buddha was not a mere teacher of the truths of
morality, but of many other sublime truths. He has
been justly called, say they, &lsquo;the Light of Asia,&rsquo;
though they condescendingly admit that Christianity
as a later development is more adapted to become
the religion of the world.</p>
<p>Let us then inquire, for a moment, what claim Gautama
Buddha has to this title&mdash;&lsquo;the Light of Asia?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, in the first place those who give him this name
forget that his doctrines only spread over Eastern Asia,
and that either Confucius, or Zoroaster, or Muhammad
might equally be called &lsquo;the Light of Asia.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_544">544</div>
<p>But was the Buddha, in any true sense, a Light to
any part of the world?</p>
<p>It is certainly true that the main idea implied by
Buddhism is intellectual enlightenment. Buddhism,
before all things, means enlightenment of mind, resulting
from intense self-concentration and introspection,
from intense abstract meditation, combined with
the exercise of a man&rsquo;s own reasoning faculties and
intuitions.</p>
<p>Of what nature, then, was the so-called Light of
Knowledge that radiated from the Buddha? Was it
the knowledge of his own utter weakness, of his original
depravity of heart, or of the origin of sin? No;
the Buddha&rsquo;s light was in these respects profound
darkness. He confessed himself, in regard to such
momentous questions, a downright Agnostic. The
primary origin of evil&mdash;the first evil act&mdash;was to him
an inexplicable mystery.</p>
<p>Was it, then, a knowledge of the goodness, justice,
holiness, and omnipotence of a personal Creator? Was
it a knowledge of the Fatherhood of God? No; the
Buddha&rsquo;s light was in these respects also mere and
sheer darkness. In these respects, too, he acknowledged
himself a thorough Agnostic. He admitted
that he knew of no being higher than himself.</p>
<p>What, then, was the light that broke upon the
Buddha? What was this enlightenment which has
been so much written about and extolled? All that
he claimed to have discovered was the origin of suffering
and the remedy of suffering. All the light of
knowledge to which he attained came to this:&mdash;that
<span class="pb" id="Page_545">545</span>
suffering arises from indulging desires, especially the
desire for continuity of life; that suffering is inseparable
from life; that all life is suffering; and that
suffering is to be got rid of by the suppression of
desires, and by the extinction of personal existence.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the first great contrast. When the
Buddha said to his converts, &lsquo;Come (ehi), be my disciple,&rsquo;
he bade them expect to get rid of suffering, he
told them to stamp out suffering by stamping out
desires (see pp. <a href="#Page_43">43</a>, <a href="#Page_44">44</a>). When the Christ said to His
disciples, &lsquo;Come, follow Me,&rsquo; He bade them expect
suffering. He told them to glory in their sufferings&mdash;nay,
to expect the perfection of their characters through
suffering.</p>
<p>It is certainly noteworthy that both Christianity and
Buddhism agree in asserting that all creation groaneth
and travaileth in pain, in suffering, in tribulation.
But mark the vast, the vital distinction in the teaching
of each. The one taught men to be patient under
affliction, and to aim at the glorification of the suffering
body, the other taught men to be intolerant of affliction,
and to aim at the utter annihilation of the suffering
body.</p>
<p>What says our Bible? We Christians, it says, are
members of Christ&rsquo;s Body&mdash;of His flesh and of His
bones&mdash;of that Divine Body which was once a suffering
Body, a cross-bearing Body, and is now a glorified
Body, an ever-living, life-giving Body. Hence it teaches
us to honour and revere the human body; nay, almost
to deify the human body.</p>
<p>A Buddhist, on the other hand, treats every kind
<span class="pb" id="Page_546">546</span>
of body with contempt, and repudiates as a simple
impossibility, all idea of being a member of the Buddha&rsquo;s
body. How could a Buddhist be a member
of a body which was burnt to ashes&mdash;which was
calcined,&mdash;which became extinct at the moment when
the Buddha&rsquo;s whole personality became extinguished
also?</p>
<p>But, say the admirers of Buddhism, at least you
will admit that the Buddha told men to avoid sin,
and to aim at purity and holiness of life? Nothing
of the kind. The Buddha had no idea of sin as an
offence against God, no idea of true holiness (see <a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>).
What he said was&mdash;Get rid of the demerit of evil
actions and accumulate a stock of merit by good actions.</p>
<p>And let me remark here that this determination to
store up merit&mdash;like capital at a bank&mdash;is one of those
inveterate propensities of human nature, one of those irrepressible
and deep-seated tendencies in humanity which
nothing but the divine force imparted by Christianity
can ever eradicate. It is for ever cropping up in the
heart of man, as much in the West as in the East, as
much in the North as in the South; for ever re-asserting
itself like a pestilent weed, or like tares amidst
the wheat, for ever blighting the fruit of those good
instincts which underlie man&rsquo;s nature everywhere.</p>
<p>Only the other day I met an intelligent Sikh from
the Panj&#257;b, and asked him about his religion. He
replied, &lsquo;I am no idolater; I believe in One God, and
I repeat my prayers, called &ldquo;Jap-jee,&rdquo; every morning
and evening. These prayers occupy six pages of print,
<span class="pb" id="Page_547">547</span>
but I can get through them in little more than ten
minutes.&rsquo; He seemed to pride himself on this rapid
recitation as a work of increased merit.</p>
<p>I said, &lsquo;What else does your religion require of
you?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;I have made one pilgrimage to
a holy well near Amritsar. Eighty-five steps lead
down to it. I descended and bathed in the sacred
pool. Then I ascended one step and repeated my
Jap-jee with great rapidity. Then I descended again
to the pool and bathed again, and ascended to the
second step and repeated my prayers a second time.
Then I descended a third time, and ascended to the
third step and repeated my Jap-jee a third time, and
so on for the whole eighty-five steps, eighty-five
bathings and eighty-five repetitions of the same
prayers. It took me exactly fourteen hours, from
5 p.m. one evening to 7 a.m. next morning, and I
fasted all the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I asked, &lsquo;What good did you expect to get by going
through this task?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;I hope I have laid
up an abundant store of merit, which will last me for
a long time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This, let me tell you, is a genuine Hind&#363; notion.
It is of the very essence of Br&#257;hmanism, of Hind&#363;ism,
of Zoroastrianism, of Confucianism, of Muhammadanism.
It is even more of the essence of Buddhism.
For, of all systems, Buddhism is the one which lays
most stress on the accumulation of merit by good
actions, as the sole counterpoise to the mighty force
generated by the accumulation of demerit through
evil actions in present and previous forms of life.
<span class="pb" id="Page_548">548</span>
Nor did the Buddha ever claim to be a deliverer from
guilt, a purger from the taint of past pollution. He
never pretended to set any one free from the penalty,
power, and presence of sin&mdash;from the bondage of sinful
acts and besetting vices. He never professed to furnish
any cure for the leprosy of man&rsquo;s corrupt nature&mdash;any
medicine for a dying sinner<a class="fn" id="fr_283" href="#fn_283">[283]</a>. On the contrary, by his
doctrine of Karma he bound a man hand and foot to
the inevitable consequences of his own evil actions
with chains of adamant. He said, in effect, to every
one of his disciples, &lsquo;You are in slavery to a tyrant of
your own setting up; your own deeds, words, and
thoughts in your present and former states of being,
are your own avengers through a countless series of
existences.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Your acts your angels are for good or ill,</p>
<p class="t0">Your fatal shadows that walk by you still.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&lsquo;If you have been a murderer, a thief, a liar, impure,
a drunkard, you must pay the penalty in your next
birth&mdash;perhaps as a sufferer in one of the hells<a class="fn" id="fr_284" href="#fn_284">[284]</a>, perhaps
<span class="pb" id="Page_549">549</span>
in the body of a wild beast, perhaps in that of
some unclean animal or loathsome vermin, perhaps as
a demon or evil spirit. Yes, your doom is sealed.
Not in the heavens, O man, not in the midst of the
sea, not if thou hidest thyself in the clefts of the
mountains, wilt thou find a place where thou canst
escape the force of thine own evil actions<a class="fn" id="fr_285" href="#fn_285">[285]</a>. Thy
only hope of salvation is in thyself. Neither god nor
man can save thee, and I am wholly powerless to set
thee free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now, contrast the few brief words of Christ in
his first recorded sermon<a class="fn" id="fr_286" href="#fn_286">[286]</a>. &lsquo;The Spirit of the Lord is
upon Me, because He hath anointed Me to preach good
tidings to the poor; He hath sent Me to proclaim
liberty to the captives, and recovering of sight to the
blind, and the opening of the prison to them that are
bound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, in Christ alone there is deliverance from the
bondage of former transgressions, from the prison-house
of former sins; a total cancelling of the past;
a complete blotting-out of the handwriting that is
against us; an entire washing away of every guilty
stain; the opening of a clear course for every man
to start afresh; the free gift of pardon and of life
to every criminal, to every sinner&mdash;even the most
heinous and inveterate.</p>
<p>Still, I seem to hear some admirers of Buddhism
<span class="pb" id="Page_550">550</span>
say: We admit the force of these contrasts, but surely
you will allow that in the moral law of Buddha we
find precepts identically the same as those of Christianity&mdash;precepts
which tell a man not to love the
world, not to love money, not to hate his enemies,
not to do unrighteous acts, not to commit impurities,
to overcome evil by good, and to do to others as we
would be done by?</p>
<p>Well, I admit all this. Nay, I admit even more
than this; for many Buddhist precepts command total
abstinence in cases where Christianity demands only
temperance and moderation. The great contrast, as
I have already explained, between the moral precepts
of Buddhism and Christianity, is not so much in the
letter of the precepts, as in the power brought to
bear in their application.</p>
<p>Buddhism, I repeat, says: Act righteously through
your own efforts, and for the final getting rid of all suffering,
of all individuality, of all life in yourselves. Christianity
says: Be righteous through a power implanted in
you from above, through the power of a life-giving principle,
freely given to you, and always abiding in you.
The Buddha said to his followers: &lsquo;Take nothing from
me, trust to yourselves alone.&rsquo; Christ said: &lsquo;Take all
from Me; trust not to yourselves. I give unto you
eternal life, I give unto you the bread of heaven, I
give unto you living water.&rsquo; Not that these priceless
gifts involve any passive condition of inaction. On the
contrary, they stir the soul of the recipient with a
living energy. They stimulate him to noble deeds,
and self-sacrificing efforts. They compel him to act as
<span class="pb" id="Page_551">551</span>
the worthy, grateful, and appreciative possessor of so
inestimable a treasure.</p>
<p>Still, I seem to hear some one say: We acknowledge
this; we admit the truth of what you have stated;
nevertheless, for all that, you must allow that Buddhism
conferred a great benefit on India by encouraging freedom
of thought and by setting at liberty its teeming
population, before entangled in the meshes of ceremonial
observances and Brahmanical priestcraft.</p>
<p>Yes, I grant this; nay, I grant even more than this.
I admit that Buddhism conferred many other benefits
on the millions inhabiting the most populous part of
Asia. It introduced education and culture; it encouraged
literature and art; it promoted physical, moral,
and intellectual progress up to a certain point; it proclaimed
peace, good will, and brotherhood among men;
it deprecated war between nation and nation; it avowed
sympathy with social liberty and freedom; it gave
back much independence to women; it preached purity
in thought, word, and deed (though only for the accumulation
of merit); it taught self-denial without self-torture;
it inculcated generosity, charity, tolerance,
love, self-sacrifice, and benevolence, even towards the
inferior animals; it advocated respect for life and compassion
towards all creatures; it forbade avarice and
the hoarding of money; and from its declaration that a
man&rsquo;s future depended on his present acts and condition,
it did good service for a time in preventing
stagnation, stimulating exertion, promoting good works
of all kinds, and elevating the character of humanity.</p>
<p>Then again, when it spread to outlying countries it
<span class="pb" id="Page_552">552</span>
assumed the character of a religion; it taught the
existence of unseen worlds; it permitted the offering
of prayers to Maitreya and other supposed personal
saviours; it inculcated faith and trust in these celestial
beings, which operated as good motives in the hearts of
many, while the hope of being born in higher conditions
of life, and the desire to acquire merit by reverential
acts, led to the development of devotional services,
which had much in common with those performed in
Christian countries. Nay, it must even be admitted
that many Buddhists in the present day are deeply
imbued with religious feelings, and in no part of the
world are the outward manifestations of religion&mdash;such
as temples and sacred objects of all kinds&mdash;so conspicuous
as in modern Buddhist countries.</p>
<p>But if, after making all these concessions, I am told
that, on my own showing, Buddhism was a kind of
introduction to Christianity, or that Christianity is
a kind of development of Buddhism, I must ask you
to bear with me a little longer, while I point out
certain other contrasts, which ought to make it clear
to every reasonable man, how vast, how profound, how
impassable is the gulf separating the true religion from
the false philosophy, and from the later religious
systems developed out of it.</p>
<p>And first, observe that Buddhism has never claimed
to be an exclusive system. It has never aimed at
taking the place of other religions. On the contrary
it tolerates all, and a Buddhist considers that he may
be at the same time a Hind&#363;, a Confucianist, a T&#257;oist,
a Shintoist, and even, strange to say, a Christian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_553">553</div>
<p>A Christian, on the other hand, holds as a cardinal
doctrine of his religion, that there is only one Name
under heaven given among men, whereby any human
being can be saved. To be at the same time a believer
in Christ and a believer in Buddha implies an
utter contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Then it need scarcely be repeated here that Christ
is before all things a majestic example of a great
historic personality. Any really historical, matter-of-fact
account of the life of Buddha, like that of the
life of Christ by the four Evangelists, may be looked
for in vain through all the Buddhist scriptures. The
Buddha&rsquo;s biography is mixed up with such monstrous
legends, absurd figments, and extravagant fables, that
to attempt the sifting out of any really historical
element worthy of being compared with the pregnant
simplicity&mdash;the dignified brevity of the biography of
Christ, would be an idle task.</p>
<p>Still we may note two or three obvious points of
comparison and contrast.</p>
<p>And perhaps the most important is, that Christ
constantly insisted on the fact that He was God-sent,
whereas the Buddha always described himself as self
sent. How indeed could the Buddha have said &lsquo;the
great I AM hath sent me unto you<a class="fn" id="fr_287" href="#fn_287">[287]</a>&rsquo; when he had
no belief in the eternal existence of any Ego at all?
Not even in the reality of his own individuality.</p>
<p>All that he affirmed of himself was that he came
into the world to be a teacher of perfect wisdom, by
<span class="pb" id="Page_554">554</span>
a force derived from his own acts. By that force alone
he had passed through innumerable bodies of gods,
demi-gods, demons, men, and animals, until he reached
one out of numerous heavens, and thence by his own
will descended upon earth and entered the side of his
mother in the form of a white elephant (see
pp. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>, <a href="#Page_477">477</a>). Let those who speak of his &lsquo;virgin-mother&rsquo; bear
this in mind.</p>
<p>Christ, on the other hand, made known to his disciples,
that He was with His Father from everlasting,
&lsquo;Before Abraham was, I am.&rsquo; Then in the fulness
of time, He was <i>sent</i> into the world by His Father, and
was born of a pure virgin, through the power of the
Holy Spirit, in the likeness and fashion of men.</p>
<p>Next let us note a vast contrast in the fact that
Christ was sent from heaven to be born on earth
in a poor and humble station, to be reared in a cottage,
to be trained to toilsome labour as a working-man;
whereas the Buddha came down to be born on earth
in a rich and princely family; to be brought up amid
luxurious surroundings, and finally to go forth as a
mendicant-monk, depending upon others for his daily
food and doing nothing for his own support.</p>
<p>Then, again, Christ as He grew up showed no signs
of earthly majesty in his external form, whereas the
Buddha is described as marked with certain mystic
symbols of universal monarchy on his feet and on his
hands, and taller and more stately in frame and figure
than ordinary human beings (see pp. <a href="#Page_476">476</a>, <a href="#Page_501">501</a>).</p>
<p>Then, when each entered on his ministry as a teacher,
Christ was despised and rejected by kings and princes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_555">555</span>
and followed by poor and ignorant fishermen, by common
people, publicans, and sinners; Buddha was
honoured by kings and princes, and followed by rich
men and learned disciples.</p>
<p>Then Christ had all the treasures of knowledge
hidden in Himself, and made known to His disciples
that He was Himself the Way, and the Truth,&mdash;Himself
their Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification,
and Redemption. Buddha declared that all enlightenment
and wisdom were to be attained by his disciples,
not through him, but through themselves and their own
intuitions; and that, too, only after long and painful
discipline in countless successive bodily existences.</p>
<p>Then in regard to the miracles which both the Bible
and the Tripi&#7789;aka describe as attestations of the truth
of the teaching of each, contrast the simple and dignified
statement that &lsquo;the blind receive their sight, the
lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel
preached unto them<a class="fn" id="fr_288" href="#fn_288">[288]</a>,&rsquo; with the following description
of the Buddha&rsquo;s miracles in the Mah&#257;-vagga (I. 20, 24)<a class="fn" id="fr_289" href="#fn_289">[289]</a>:
&lsquo;At the command of the Blessed One the five hundred
pieces of fire-wood could not be split and were split,
the fires could not be lit up and were lit up, could not
be extinguished and were extinguished. Besides he
created five hundred vessels with fire. Thus the
number of these miracles amounts to three thousand
five hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, although each made use of missionary agency,
<span class="pb" id="Page_556">556</span>
the one sent forth his high-born learned monks as
missionaries to the world at the commencement of his
own career, giving them no divine commission; the
other waited till the close of His own ministry, and then
said to His low-born, unlearned disciples, &lsquo;As My Father
hath sent Me, even so send I you&rsquo; (St. John xx. 21).</p>
<p>Then, when we come to compare the death of each,
the contrast reaches its climax; for Christ was put to
death violently by wicked men, and died in agony an
atoning death, suffering for the sins of the world at
the age of thirty-three, leaving behind in Jerusalem
about one hundred and twenty disciples after a short
ministry of three years. Whereas the Buddha died
peacefully among his friends, suffering from an attack
of indigestion at the age of eighty, leaving behind
many thousands of disciples after forty-five years of
teaching and preaching.</p>
<p>And what happened after the death of each? Christ,
the Holy One, saw no corruption, but rose again in
His present glorified body, and is alive for evermore&mdash;nay,
has life in Himself ever flowing in life-giving
streams towards His people. The Buddha is dead and
gone for ever; his body, according to the testimony of
his own disciples, was burnt more than 400 years
before the Advent of Christ, and its ashes were distributed
everywhere as relics.</p>
<p>Even according to the Buddha&rsquo;s own declaration, he
now lives only in the doctrine which he left behind
him for the guidance of his followers.</p>
<p>And here again, in regard to the doctrine left behind
by each, a vast distinction is to be noted. For the
<span class="pb" id="Page_557">557</span>
doctrine delivered by Christ to His disciples is to
spread by degrees everywhere until it prevails eternally.
Whereas the doctrine left by Buddha, though it advanced
rapidly by leaps and bounds, is, according to
his own admission, to fade away by degrees, till at
the end of 5000 years it has disappeared altogether
from the earth, and another Buddha must descend to restore
it. (Compare Postscript at end of Preface, <a href="#Page_xiv">p. xiv</a>.)</p>
<p>Then that other Buddha must be followed by countless
succeeding Buddhas in succeeding ages, whereas
there is only one Christ, who can have no successor,
for He is alive for ever and for ever present with His
people: &lsquo;Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
of the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then observe that, although the Buddha&rsquo;s doctrine
was ultimately written down by his disciples in certain
collections of books, in the same manner as the doctrine
of Christ, a fundamental difference of character&mdash;nay,
a vast and impassable gulf of difference&mdash;separates
the Sacred Books of each, the Bible of the Christian
and the Bible of the Buddhist.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the Christian&rsquo;s Bible is that
it claims to be a supernatural revelation, yet it attaches
no mystical talismanic virtue to the mere
sound of its words. On the other hand, the characteristic
of the Buddhist Bible is that it utterly repudiates
all claim to be a supernatural revelation; yet the very
sound of its words is believed to possess a meritorious
efficacy capable of elevating any one who hears it to
heavenly abodes in future existences. In illustration
I may advert to a legend current in Ceylon, that once
<span class="pb" id="Page_558">558</span>
on a time 500 bats lived in a cave where two monks
daily recited the Buddha&rsquo;s Law. These bats gained
such merit by simply hearing the sound of the words,
that, when they died, they were all re-born as men, and
ultimately as gods.</p>
<p>Then as to the words themselves, contrast the
severely simple and dignified style of the Bible narrative,
its brevity, perspicuity, vigour, and sublimity, its
trueness to nature and inimitable pathos, with the feeble
utterances, the tedious diffuseness, and I might almost
say &lsquo;the inane twaddle&rsquo; and childish repetitions of the
greater portion of the Tripi&#7789;aka (see <a href="#fn_280">note 2, p. 541</a>).</p>
<p>But again, I am sure to hear the admirers of Buddhism
say: Is it not the case that the doctrine of
Buddha, like the doctrine of Christ, has self-sacrifice as
its key-note? Well, be it so. I admit that the Buddha
taught a kind of self-sacrifice. I admit that he related
of himself that, on a particular occasion in one of his
previous births<a class="fn" id="fr_290" href="#fn_290">[290]</a>, he plucked out his own eyes, and,
that on another, he cut off his own head as a sacrifice
for the good of others; and that again, on a third
occasion, he cut his own body to pieces to redeem a
dove from a hawk<a class="fn" id="fr_291" href="#fn_291">[291]</a>. Yet note the vast distinction
between the self-sacrifice taught by the two systems.
Christianity demands the suppression of selfishness;
Buddhism demands the suppression of self, with the
one object of extinguishing all consciousness of self. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_559">559</span>
the one, the true self is elevated and intensified. In
the other, the true self is annihilated by the practice
of a false form of non-selfishness, which has for its real
object, not the good of others, but the annihilation of
the Ego, the utter extinction of the illusion of personal
individuality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, observe the following contrasts in the
doctrines which each bequeathed to his followers:&mdash;</p>
<p>According to Christianity:&mdash;Fight and overcome the
world.</p>
<p>According to Buddhism:&mdash;Shun the world, and withdraw
from it.</p>
<p>According to Christianity:&mdash;Expect a new earth when
the present earth is destroyed; a world renewed and
perfected; a purified world in which righteousness is
to dwell for ever.</p>
<p>According to Buddhism:&mdash;Expect a never-ending succession
of evil worlds for ever coming into existence,
developing, decaying, perishing, and reviving, and all
equally full of everlasting misery, disappointment, illusion,
change, and transmutation.</p>
<p>According to Christianity, bodily existence is subject
to only one transformation.</p>
<p>According to Buddhism, bodily existence is continued
in six conditions, through countless bodies of
men, animals, demons, ghosts, and dwellers in various
hells and heavens; and that, too, without any progressive
development, but in a constant jumble of metamorphoses
and transmutations (see <a href="#Page_122">p. 122</a>).</p>
<p>Christianity teaches that a life in heaven can never
be followed by a fall to a lower state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_560">560</div>
<p>Buddhism teaches that a life in a higher heaven may
be succeeded by a life in a lower heaven, or even by
a life on earth or in one of the hells.</p>
<p>According to Christianity, the body of man may be
the abode of the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
<p>According to Buddhism, the body whether of men or
of higher beings can never be the abode of anything
but evil.</p>
<p>According to Christianity:&mdash;Present your bodies as
living sacrifices, holy, acceptable to God, and expect
a change to glorified bodies hereafter.</p>
<p>According to Buddhism:&mdash;Look to final deliverance
from all bodily life, present and to come, as the greatest
of all blessings, highest of all boons, and loftiest of
all aims.</p>
<p>According to Christianity, a man&rsquo;s body can never be
changed into the body of a beast, or bird, or insect, or
loathsome vermin.</p>
<p>According to Buddhism, a man, and even a god, may
become an animal of any kind, and even the most
loathsome vermin may again become a man or a god.</p>
<p>According to Christianity:&mdash;Stray not from God&rsquo;s
ways; offend not against His holy laws.</p>
<p>According to Buddhism:&mdash;Stray not from the eight-fold
path of the perfect man, and offend not against
yourself and the law of the perfect man.</p>
<p>According to Christianity:&mdash;Work the works of God
while it is day.</p>
<p>According to Buddhism:&mdash;Beware of action, as causing
re-birth, and aim at inaction, indifference, and
apathy, as the highest of all states.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_561">561</div>
<p>Then note other contrasts.</p>
<p>According to the Christian Bible:&mdash;Regulate and
sanctify the heart, desires, and affections.</p>
<p>According to the Buddhist:&mdash;Suppress and destroy
them utterly, if you wish for true sanctification.</p>
<p>Christianity teaches that in the highest form of life,
love is intensified.</p>
<p>Buddhism teaches that in the highest state of existence,
all love is extinguished.</p>
<p>According to Christianity:&mdash;Go and earn your own
bread, support yourself and your family. Marriage, it
says, is honourable and undefiled, and married life is
a field on which holiness may grow and be developed.
Nay, more&mdash;Christ Himself honoured a wedding with
His presence, and took up little children in His arms
and blessed them.</p>
<p>Buddhism, on the other hand, says:&mdash;Avoid married
life; shun it as if it were &lsquo;a burning pit of live coals&rsquo;
(<a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>); or, having entered on it, abandon wife,
children, and home, and go about as celibate monks,
engaging in nothing but in meditation and recitation
of the Buddha&rsquo;s Law&mdash;that is to say&mdash;if you aim at
the highest degree of sanctification.</p>
<p>And then comes the important contrast that in
the one system we have a teaching gratifying to the
pride of man, and flattering to his intellect; while in
the other we have a teaching humbling to his pride,
and distasteful to his intellect. For Christianity tells
us that we must become as little children, and that
when we have done all that we can, we are still unprofitable
servants. Whereas Buddhism teaches that
<span class="pb" id="Page_562">562</span>
every man is saved by his own works and by his own
merits only.</p>
<p>Fitly, indeed, do the rags worn by the monks of
true Buddhism symbolize the miserable patchwork of
its own self-righteousness.</p>
<p>Not that Christianity ignores the necessity for good
works; on the contrary, no other system insists on a
lofty morality so strongly; but never as the meritorious
instrument of salvation<a class="fn" id="fr_292" href="#fn_292">[292]</a>&mdash;only as a thank-offering,
only as the outcome and evidence of faith.</p>
<p>Lastly, we must advert again to the most momentous&mdash;the
most essential of all the distinctions which
separate Christianity from Buddhism. Christianity
regards personal life as the most sacred of all possessions.
Life, it seems to say, is no dream, no illusion.
&lsquo;Life is real, life is earnest.&rsquo; Life is the most precious
of all God&rsquo;s gifts. Nay, it affirms of God Himself
that He is the highest Example of intense Life&mdash;of
intense personality, the great &lsquo;I AM that I AM,&rsquo; and
teaches us that we are to thirst for a continuance of
personal life as a gift for Him; nay, more, that we are
to thirst for the living God Himself and for conformity
<span class="pb" id="Page_563">563</span>
to His likeness; while Buddhism sets forth as the
highest of all aims the utter extinction of the illusion
of personal identity&mdash;the utter annihilation of the Ego&mdash;of
all existence in any form whatever, and proclaims
as the only true creed the ultimate resolution
of everything into nothing, of every entity into pure
nonentity.</p>
<p>What shall I do to inherit eternal life?&mdash;says the
Christian. What shall I do to inherit eternal extinction
of life?&mdash;says the Buddhist.</p>
<p>It seems a mere absurdity to have to ask in concluding
these Lectures:&mdash;Whom shall we choose as our
Guide, our Hope, our Salvation, &lsquo;the Light of Asia,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;the Light of the World?&rsquo; the Buddha or the Christ?
It seems a mere mockery to put this final question
to rational and thoughtful men in the nineteenth
century: Which Book shall we clasp to our hearts in
our last hour&mdash;the Book that tells us of the dead, the
extinct, the death-giving Buddha, or the Book that
reveals to us the living, the eternal, the life-giving
Christ?</p>
<h3>POSTSCRIPT.</h3>
<p>Since the printing of my concluding Lecture, it has
occurred to me that I ought to make a few remarks in regard
to a very prevalent error&mdash;the error that Buddhism
still numbers more adherents than any other religion of
the world. For these remarks the reader is referred to
the Postscript at the end of the Preface (<a href="#Page_xiv">p. xiv</a>).</p>

LL.D.&rsquo; London: Hodder and Stoughton; published first in 1879,
and a popular edition in 1881.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>A reference to pages <a href="#Page_74">74</a>, <a href="#Page_226">226</a>, <a href="#Page_232">232</a> of the following Lectures will
make the connexion which I wish to illustrate clearer. In many
images of the Buddha the robe is drawn over both shoulders, as in the
portrait of the living Sanny&#257;s&#299;. Then mark other particulars in the
portrait:&mdash;e.g. the Rudr&#257;ksha rosary round the neck (see &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism
and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; p. 67). Then in front of the raised seat of the Sanny&#257;s&#299;
are certain ceremonial implements. First, observe the Kama&#7751;&#7693;alu, or
water-gourd, near the right hand corner of the seat. Next, in front
of the seat, on the right hand of the figure, is the Upa-p&#257;tra&mdash;a subsidiary
vessel to be used with the Kama&#7751;&#7693;alu. Then, in the middle,
is the T&#257;mra-p&#257;tra or copper vessel, and on the left the Pa&ntilde;&#263;a-p&#257;tra
with the &#256;&#263;aman&#299; (see &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism and Hind&#363;ism,&rsquo; pp. 401, 402).
Near the left hand corner of the seat are the wooden clogs. Finally,
there is the Da&#7751;&#7693;a or staff held in the left hand, and used by a Sanny&#257;s&#299;
as a defence against evil spirits, much as the Dorje (or Vajra) is used
by Northern Buddhist monks (see <a href="#Page_323">p. 323</a> of the present volume).
This mystical staff is a bambu with six knots, possibly symbolical of
six ways (Gati) or states of life, through which it is believed that every
being may have to migrate&mdash;a belief common to both Br&#257;hmanism and
Buddhism (see <a href="#Page_122">p. 122</a> of this volume). The staff is called Su-dar&#7777;ana (a
name for Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s &#262;akra), and is daily worshipped for the preservation
of its mysterious powers. The mystic white roll which begins just
above the left hand and ends before the left knot is called the Lakshm&#299;-vastra,
or auspicious covering. The projecting piece of cloth folded in
the form of an axe (Para&#7777;u) represents the weapon of Para&#7777;u-R&#257;ma,
one of the incarnations of Vish&#7751;u (see pp. 110, 270 of &lsquo;Br&#257;hmanism
and Hind&#363;ism&rsquo;) with which he subdued the enemies of the Br&#257;hmans.
With this so-called axe may be contrasted the Buddhist weapon for
keeping off the powers of evil (engraved at <a href="#Page_352">p. 352</a>).

the Upanishads, Itih&#257;sas, and Pur&#257;&#7751;as were all the breath
(ni&#7717;&#7777;vasit&#257;ni) of the Supreme Being. And S&#257;ya&#7751;a, the well-known
Indian Commentator on the &#7770;ig-veda, speaking of the Supreme Being
in his Introduction, says, Yasya ni&#7717;&#7777;vasita&#7747; Ved&#257;&#7717;, &lsquo;whose breath

standard is the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a language as opposed to the Sa&#7747;hit&#257; of the
Veda and to Loka or ordinary usage.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_21" href="#fr_21">[21]</a>According to Professor Rhys Davids, the P&#257;li text of the whole
Tri-pi&#7789;aka, or true Canon of Buddhist Scripture, contains about twice
as many words as our Bible; but he calculates that an English translation,
if all repetitions were given, would be about four times as
long. I should state here that in this chapter Koeppen, Childers, Rhys
Davids, and Oldenberg have all been referred to, though I have not
failed to examine the original P&#257;li documents myself.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_22" href="#fr_22">[22]</a>Up&#257;li is said to have been originally the family barber of the
&#7776;&#257;kyas. Professor Oldenberg rightly remarks that this did not make
him a man of low position, though he was probably the lowest in rank
of all the early disciples of Gautama.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_23" href="#fr_23">[23]</a>Professor Oldenberg, in his preface to his edition of the Mah&#257;-vagga,
shows that in early times there were only two divisions of the
Pi&#7789;aka, one called Vinaya and the other Dharma (Dhamma), which
were often contrasted.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_24" href="#fr_24">[24]</a>The ten usually enumerated are the three above-named and seven
others, viz. power of admitting to the Order and confession in private
houses, the use of comfortable seats, relaxation of monastic rules in remote
country places, power of obtaining a dispensation from the Order
<i>after</i> the infringement of a rule, drinking whey, putting salt aside for
future use, power of citing the example of others as a valid excuse for
relaxing discipline.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_25" href="#fr_25">[25]</a>According to Professor Oldenberg&rsquo;s calculation. The date is
doubtful. A round number (say 350 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) might be given.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_26" href="#fr_26">[26]</a>Professor Oldenberg places the locality of the P&#257;li on the
eastern coast of Southern India in the northern part of Kali&#7749;ga
(Pur&#299; in Orissa), and would therefore make it an old form of Uriya.
That country he thinks had most frequent communications with Ceylon.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_27" href="#fr_27">[27]</a>Professor Childers thought that P&#257;li merely meant the language
of the line or series of texts, the word p&#257;li like tanti meaning &lsquo;line.&rsquo;
P&#257;li differs from the Pr&#257;k&#7771;it of the Inscriptions, and from that of the
dramas, and from that of the Jainas (which is still later and called
Ardha-m&#257;gadh&#299;), by its retention of some consonants and infusion of
Sansk&#7771;it. The G&#257;th&#257; dialect of the northern books is again different.

called Northern A&#7777;oka or Ariano-P&#257;li&mdash;is clearly
Semitic, and traceable to a Ph&oelig;nician source, being written from
right to left. That at Girn&#257;r, commonly called Southern A&#7777;oka or
Indo-P&#257;li, is read from left to right, and is not so clearly traceable.
If it came from the west it probably came through a Pahlav&#299; channel,
and gave rise to Devan&#257;gar&#299;. General Cunningham and others believe
this latter character to have originated independently in India.

Indicarum.&rsquo; The General reckons thirteen rock inscriptions, seventeen
cave inscriptions, and six inscribed pillars.
<p class="fncont">The eight most important rock inscriptions are those on (1) the Rock
of Kapurda-garhi (at Sh&#257;hb&#257;z-garhi), in British Afgh&#257;nist&#257;n, forty miles
east-north-east of Pesh&#257;war&mdash;this is in the Ariano-P&#257;li character;
(2) the Rock of Kh&#257;lsi, situated on the bank of the river Jumn&#257;, just
where it leaves the Him&#257;laya mountains, fifteen miles west of the hill-station
of Mussourie; (3) the Rock of Girn&#257;r, half-a-mile to the east
of the city of Junagurh, in K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r; (4) the Rock of Dhauli, in
Kuttack (properly Ka&#7789;ak), twenty miles north of Jagan-n&#257;th; (5) the
Rock of Jaugada, in a large old fort eighteen miles west-north-west of
Ganjam in Madras; (6) Bair&#257;t; (7) R&#363;pn&#257;th, at the foot of the Kaimur
range; (8) Sahasar&#257;m, at the north-east end of the Kaimur. The second
Bair&#257;t inscription is most important as the only one which mentions
Buddha by name.</p>
<p class="fncont">The five most important pillars are: (1) the Pillar at Delhi known
as Firoz Sh&#257;h&rsquo;s L&#257;&#7789;; (2) another Pillar at Delhi, which was removed
to Calcutta, but has recently been restored; (3) the Pillar at Allah&#257;b&#257;d,
a single shaft without capital, of polished sandstone, thirty-five
feet in height; (4) the Pillar at Lauriya, near Bettiah, in Bengal; (5)

evidence of some violent persecution. I may instance among the
places I visited Tanjore and Madura. When I concluded the reading
of a paper on this subject at the meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society
on February 15, 1886, the then President, Colonel Yule, justly
remarked that the members of two religious communions who hold
very similar doctrines, often on that account hate and oppose each
other all the more; but my point was that the ultra-tolerance
which was of the very essence of both Br&#257;hmanism and Buddhism
must have prevented actual persecution, except under special circumstances.
Br&#257;hmanism was much more likely to have adopted
Buddhism as part of its system, than to have persecuted and expelled
it. In point of fact, the Br&#257;hmans, as is well known, are ready to
regard any great teacher as one of Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s incarnations, and in this
way are even willing to pay homage to the Head of Christianity.

Resident at Lh&#257;ssa, stating that a certain Tibetan official called the
Nominhan (see <a href="#Page_286">p. 286</a> of this volume) had reported to him that he
had found three young boys of remarkable intelligence and acuteness,
into one of whom beyond a doubt the spirit of the late L&#257;ma of
Tashi Lunpo (one of the two supreme pontiffs) had passed. Thereupon
the Chinese Resident sent a report to Peking, asking that the ceremony
of selecting one of these three children might be permitted. By the time
the authority arrived, the Nominhan with the children had reached
Lh&#257;ssa, and a lucky day was chosen for the ceremony. The golden
vase in which the lots are cast was brought and placed before the
image of the Emperor. Prayers were chanted before the assembled
L&#257;mas, and the children were conducted into the presence of the
Resident and Tibetan authorities in order that their intelligence and
difference from other persons might be tested.&rsquo;

Csoma de K&ouml;r&ouml;s, already mentioned (at <a href="#Page_70">p. 70</a>), was the first European
to throw light on the Tibetan language. He had been impelled to
acquire it by the task he had imposed on himself of searching out the
progenitors of his race. More than eighty years ago he set out on his
travels, and his search ultimately brought him to Tibet. There he
devoted himself to the study of the Tibetan language and its sacred
literature, taking up his abode in the monastery of Pugdal, in defiance
of intense cold and other hardships. But his heroic energy did not end
there. In 1831 he travelled from Tibet to Calcutta, and in that city,
about the year 1834, published his Grammar and Dictionary of the
Tibetan language, besides his table of contents of the Kanjur and the
extra-canonical treatises. At length fancying himself qualified for the
accomplishment of his self-inflicted task, he started off again, and died
in Sikkim in April 1842. He is buried at D&#257;rj&#299;ling. We Englishmen,
who ought to have taken the greatest share in these linguistic
conquests&mdash;so important in their bearing on the interests of our
Indian frontier&mdash;have hitherto, to our great discredit, almost entirely
neglected them. Meanwhile, St. Petersburg and Paris have founded
chairs of the Tibetan language, and nearly all that has been effected
for promoting the study of Tibetan has been due to Russian and
French scholars, and to German and Moravian missionaries, especially
to J&auml;schke and Hyde.
<p class="fncont">I am glad, however, to see from the annual address delivered by
the President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and published in the

Buddha was probably called so because he is fabled to have wandered
about as a deer in this very place in one of his former births (see
<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a> of this volume). The legend is that he was born eleven times
as a deer, and on this account a deer is one of the sacred symbols of
Buddhism. We learn from General Sir A. Cunningham (i. 105) that
the name S&#257;rn&#257;th properly belongs to a temple dedicated to &#7776;iva near
the Buddhist monument, and the epithet &lsquo;Lord of deer,&rsquo; is equally

as such, even in better conservation than is Christianity, the Buddhism
of the West.&rsquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_280" href="#fr_280">[280]</a>As instances of the trivialities I give the following from the
&#262;ulla-vagga (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xx. v, 31, p. 146; v, 9.
5, p. 87):&mdash;
<p class="fncont">&lsquo;Now at that time the Bhikkhus hung up their bowls on pins in the
walls, or on hooks. The pins or hooks falling down, the bowls were
broken. They told this matter to the Blessed One. &ldquo;You are not,
O Bhikkhus, to hang your bowls up. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukkata&rdquo; (offence). Now at that time the Bhikkhus
put their bowls down on a bed, or a chair; and sitting down
thoughtlessly they upset them, and the bowls were broken. They
told this matter to the Blessed One. &ldquo;You are not, O Bhikkhus, to
put your bowls on a bed, or on a chair. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukkata&rdquo; (offence). Now at that time the Bhikkhus kept
their bowls on their laps; and rising up thoughtlessly they upset them,
and the bowls were broken. They told this matter to the Blessed
One. &ldquo;You are not, O Bhikkhus, to keep your bowls on your laps.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukkata&rdquo; (offence). Now at
that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls down on a sunshade; and the
sunshade being lifted up by a whirlwind, the bowls rolled over and
were broken. They told this matter to the Blessed One. &ldquo;You are
not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls down on a sunshade. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukkata.&rdquo; Now at that time the
Bhikkhus, when they were holding the bowls in their hands, opened
the door. The door springing back, the bowls were broken. They
told this matter to the Blessed One. &ldquo;You are not, O Bhikkhus, to
open the door with your bowls in your hands. Whosoever does so,
shall be guilty of a dukkata.&rdquo; Now at that time the Bhikkhus did
not use tooth-sticks, and their mouths got a bad odour. They told this
matter to the Blessed One. &ldquo;There are these five disadvantages, O
Bhikkhus, in not using tooth-sticks&mdash;it is bad for the eyes&mdash;the
mouth becomes bad-smelling&mdash;the passages by which the flavours of
the food pass are not pure&mdash;bile and phlegm get into the food&mdash;and
the food does not taste well to him who does not use them. These
are the five disadvantages, O Bhikkhus, in not using tooth-sticks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There are five advantages, O Bhikkhus&rdquo; (etc., the converse of the
last). &ldquo;I allow you, O Bhikkhus, tooth-sticks.&rdquo; Now at that time
the &#262;habbaggiya Bhikkhus used long tooth-sticks; and even struck
the S&#257;ma&#7751;eras with them. They told this matter to the Blessed One.
&ldquo;You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use too long tooth-sticks. Whosoever
does so, shall be guilty of a dukkata. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, tooth-sticks
up to eight finger-breadths in length. And S&#257;ma&#7751;eras are not
to be struck with them. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukkata.&rdquo; Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu, when using too short
a tooth-stick got it stuck in his throat. They told this matter to the
Blessed One. &ldquo;You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use too short a tooth-stick.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukkata. I allow you,
O Bhikkhus, tooth-sticks four finger-breadths long at the least.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

of the Bishop of Colombo&rsquo;s article in the July (1888) number of
the &lsquo;Nineteenth Century,&rsquo; I need not say that I wish here, as the
Bishop has done, to draw attention to the collection of &lsquo;moral horrors&rsquo;
existing in some parts of the P&#257;r&#257;jika books&mdash;the disgusting detail of
every conceivable form of revolting vice, supposed to be perpetrated
or perpetrable by monks.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_282" href="#fr_282">[282]</a>Dr. Kellogg, in his excellent work, &lsquo;the Light of Asia and the
Light of the World,&rsquo; well criticizes Professor Seydel&rsquo;s Buddhist-Christian
Harmony, as well as the Professor&rsquo;s views on this point expressed in
his work entitled &lsquo;Das Evangelium von Jesu in Seinen Verh&auml;ltnissen
zu Buddha-Sage und Buddha-Lehre.&rsquo; Leipzig, 1880.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_283" href="#fr_283">[283]</a>It is true that in the Lalita-vistara Buddha is described in terms
which appear to assimilate his character to the Christian conception
of a Saviour; but how could any man, however good and great, have
any claim to be called either a Saviour or Redeemer, who only
revealed to his fellow-men such a method of getting rid of pain
and suffering, through their own works and merits, as must lead
them in the end to extinction of all personal existence? The very
essence of Christ&rsquo;s character as a Saviour is His divine power of
transferring His own perfect merits to imperfect men, and leading
them from death to eternal life, not to eternal extinction of life.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_292" href="#fr_292">[292]</a>A Buddhist writer in a Buddhist magazine, published in Ceylon,
has lately taken me to task for asserting in a recent speech that
Christianity denies the all-sufficiency of good works as an instrument
of salvation. It is easy to quote passages, such as those in the epistle
of St. James, in support of his one-sided view of this question, but I
need scarcely say that the writer has much to learn as to the true
character of our Bible, in which no text has full force without its
context, and no part can be taken to establish a doctrine without a
comparison with other parts, and without the balancing of apparent
contradictions in both Old and New Testaments.
